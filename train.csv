4,bullying,"I got made fun of for being fat in elementary, middle, and even high school. People would always go out of their way to tell me how fat I was and how unattractive that made me, especially in comparison to other girls. My nickname in third through fifth grade was ‘sumo wrestler,’ and once a boy drew a sumo wrestler on the blackboard and labeled it with my name. Even today, objectively knowing I am a pretty small person, I always feel fat. I’m working to unlearn harmful beauty standards and body dysmorphia, but years of bullying means I get triggered in the most unexpected ways, like when I’m at the beach or when a fat girl is made fun of in a movie."
8,sexual_harassment,"I work for a non-profit, and one of the services we provide is access to grant funding so that people can go back to school. I was signing up an older gentleman, asking the usual questions about unemployment and supplemental income, and literally in the middle of the conversation, he stopped me mid-sentence and asked, 'Has anyone ever told you you are so sexy?' I gave him my best icy glare, told him to please focus, and went on with my inquiry."
8,racism,"I would have been about 13. I got chased from a Leicester City football match, from the Leicester City stadium by a Leicester City fan back to the town centre. And I'm a young kid. He's calling me a black this and that. I don't know what he is going to do to me, he definitely wasn't going to hug me. The toughest thing for a black player coming through the ranks and then making it, is how you’re perceived in the black community and that role model that you’ve got to present yourself in a certain way. That was tough for me because I knew that I was representing a community, so if I did something wrong it was a whole community that would suffer not me."

8,racism,"Help me. I am being harassed at the office just because I am an Asian. We are a team of 40 out of which 35 are Americans, 3are Mexicans and 2 are Asians. We both are being harassed. They use racial slurs and tease us. They also treat us like janitors even though we are senior developers. They make us get coffee for them and do extra office hours too while they all leave early. I tried to contact the boss but he himself is involved in this. He threatened me that if I leak this information out he will take my job away. I don't know what to do. Please help me."
7,asia,I do not like these asians roaming around in our streets. It feels like filth and disgust when they are around. So this chinese man sits right besides me in my office. He thinks he is super genius but the fuck he knows anything. He is true shit. I wonder why the boss even hired him. I have tried to tell the HR that i suspect something odd of him but everytime they tend not to listen to me. These fucking idiots should not be even given a job here in our country. I aint gonna stand here quietly and do nothing. I am gonna follow him tonight and when the time suits me i would punch him in the face and put him right where that filth belongs.
5,loss,"Nick died tragically early in January 2015. He was 22 years of age. Nick was part of the usual less than perfect family; with brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, friends and various others who loved and confused him with equal measure. As a child Nick was diagnosed as having ADHD and later this was clarified as Asperger's syndrome. This meant that Nick's experience of the world was more confusing than for most of us, as the analytical stream of his brain and the emotional stream were less interconnected. He was to experience learning difficulties, his parents' divorce, his mother dying much too soon, having to take what work might be offered and various tribulations of life."
8,sexual_harassment,"I worked as a photographer for the local newspaper when I was putting myself through college. One day on a shoot, the top dog on location pulled me aside and told me that he thinks about me when he’s sleeping with his wife. He had an 18-year-old daughter, yet he felt I️t was okay to not only sexualize me, but isolate me at my place of work where I couldn’t lash out in retaliation. I told my boss, who said, 'That’s the industry, and when you look like that you should expect I️t.'"

I am writing this to you all to let you know that the time has come for us to stand up and take the matters in our own hands. We have now to show these white pigs what we are made of. Why are these white people so much racist and biased. Why cant these white people see the atrocities they are doing against us. We will make these white people pay, and we will make them accountable for sure this time. If you are with me then stand with us."

5,loss,"My friend suffered sexual abuse as a child. She was sexually abused by her father and grandfather. She had been molested in front of her, so I knew that something was going on there. When she was about eight or nine, my mom came over for dinner—my dad and I were home alone"

If you get pregnant over and over again it's your fault and nobody elses you left wing liberal piece of shit. Go be a whore. Keep spreading disease. Half of all black women have herpes. And we have the right to pay for it. You are outrageous."
5,bullying,"When you’re desperate to remain invisible, you begin to think that anything that could go wrong, will go wrong. It wasn’t until after leaving school, that I realised that these fears hadn’t subsided. It wasn’t just the kids at school whose opinions I feared, and who I didn’t want to look like a fool in front of, it was the wider world, a world which I was now a part of. When I was much older I was able to pin down exactly what was going on in my mind, and why these things made me feel the way I did – I had anxiety. Once I realised exactly what was going on with my mind, and could put a label on it, I began opening up to my friends and family about how I was feeling. It wasn’t a sob story, or even a plea for help, in fact, once I was able to open up about it, the first instinct was to share a laugh about it."
4,religion,Last year I decided to come back to my home country mostly because of people back lashing me on the basis of my religion. Many times when I used to go to Mosque for prayer people use to abuse me and belittle me. The collegues in the office when notice me not drinking alcohol then call me 'paki'.I never liked all of this and I started having thought to do harm to the people of that community. I am relieved I am back to my home country.
8,sexual_harassment,"Working in Silicon Valley, I didn't expect that being gay would raise an issue with anyone. After three years with the company (and being out), I brought my other half to the company holiday party. On the following Monday, peers from another department stood outside my office and cracked some really disgusting gay and AIDS jokes, yukking it up all the while. At lunchtime, I sought out one of our HR reps, who was also gay. He cautioned me to not make this into an issue as he didn't think it would go well for me in the long run."
5,bullying,"In my late 20's I made the mistake of thinking that I might not want to be around anymore. My depression was beginning to take over my life. Even relatively normal heartaches seem to affect me much greater than the average person. I was experiencing migraines that started at the age of 12. The older I got, the worse they got. I felt like I had lost complete control over my life, so I was going to try to kill myself. I was using an old razor, and when I didn't receive the desired effect, I kept going. Eventually, I stopped thinking about dying and starting to experience what could only be described as calm. I had no idea that this was a thing. My mind just kept taking me back to the thought that I was such a failure, I couldn't even kill myself correctly."
6,religious,"Some members of the cabinet are dead was, and will be, the worst of my life. I am certain that nothing will ever compare to this pain. Nothing we do in this moment, aside from hurting ourselves or others, is wrong. I screamed the word no for hours until my voice was gone. I sat in silent shock while a police officer and the victim services person (close friends, as we live in a small community) sat in our small living room and spoke softly, about what, I have no idea… Somehow flooded a love toward me. Somehow I realized when myself got myself to bed that this was what cared me most days…eventually apologizing for the terrible atrocities that has happened to me."

These muslims are constantly building their mosques on our land and their children are mixing with ours and brainwashing our children. This cannot go on, we have to do something to stop this. I am requesting you all to stand with me, to stand against these intruders. We will get into their places and clean them from the face of our land. These muslims will face our wraths."

I won't hand over the tape to the police if you obey what I say and follow my directions. So it's pretty basic and clear that I am into you and you not gonna be into me cuz of your wife and kids. So you going to come over my house and do it with me otherwise you going to jail boy. I freaking like that body of yours and I want that. So remember to be there tomorrow at 9."

What drove me to the edge was my uncle dying in front of me months before. I can still remember me crying helplessly while pumping his heart and seeing his life slowly fading away."
5,bullying,"We were actually kicked out by my ex from home in the middle of the night. He went to the kids room, woke them up in the middle of the night, and we were kicked out of our home. I think [it was because] earlier that evening, I had a conversation with him because our Christian counselling session was coming up and usually what happened before a counselling session was, he would work me up to a stage that when I went to the counsellors office he would act like the calm and the more trustworthy partner in the relationship and I would be more hysterical, so to speak."
5,loss,"I remember sitting there every night, wishing things would get better with us. Wishing we still Had what we first had. Knowing I still loved you knowing I would always be there for you.

5,family_abuse,"I met this woman at Uni whilst doing research. When she broke up with her guy she phoned me and I asked her out. At first it was blissful. Soon she started getting very upset with my clothes. As the relationship wore on we decided to get engaged. She would call me names and she hurt me because she regularly called me ignorant. She got jealous when I phoned or visited my two male friends, with whom I used to go out and have a pizza or drink when I had not yet met her. She accused me of being bad, of looking at other women. When we went to do up her flat, she sought to belittle me and my capabilities. She would never admit that she’d be at fault. She hit me physically twice. In time I grew very weary of her, I grew afraid, I used to worry that while asleep she could hit or even kill me."
8,racism,"When my father arrived in this country from Nigeria in the mid-1960s to study, he faced an awful amount of racism. He has first-hand experience of looking for accommodation and finding signs in windows saying: No Blacks, No Irish, No Dogs. He had his car vandalised on numerous occasions and laughs now about being sent to work close to the furnace of a steel plant without enough protection because he ‘should be used to the heat’. But at the time, I can only imagine how he must have felt."
8,religious_harassment,"Women must stay in their homes. They should not come outside of their houses and must refrain from seeing any other man who they do not know. I said to my wife that she has to obey what I say. My religion does not allow women to go outside and I will not tolerate this as well. I have said to her that she does not need to go to university, she does not need to do a job and she does not need to meet anyone other than me. She has to do veil even if she goes out with me. This is against our religion and I will not allow her. She has to obey otherwise I am even allowed to beat her. She says that she has the religious rights to be free and I am here to protect her not refrain her in any way. She has come from a well off family so she thinks that she can do anything without my permission but she will understand that this is my house and I am the owner so she will do only what I have to say. Otherwise the consequences will be swear."
8,sexual_harassment,"Catcalling just really makes me feel uncomfortable. Even before I was insecure about that, but now I feel really insecure. Now I feel like I have to cover myself up and hide myself, and I don’t really like feeling like I have to hide myself. Teachers don’t really say anything about it, students don’t really say anything about it. Me, my friends, we talk about this all the time. But sometimes we’re not really sure how to feel. We haven’t really been taught about what we should say, and what we should do. At my school, we don’t have resources. We don’t have anything regarding consent. We don't have anything like that on our campus, or they just don’t tell us."
8,racism,"I was refereeing a game and was being observed as well. I sent a player off and he called me an effing P***. I was quite taken aback by it. It was my first year in refereeing and I thought, 'is refereeing actually like this, what’s the point in carrying on? Why should I come out on a cold winter’s day and take this abuse?' Luckily the observer heard it as well. Unfortunately, the players denied it. I called the captain over and said 'you heard what he said and I will be reporting it'. But they continued to deny it and said it wasn’t aimed at me - but I was the only Asian on the field. I started doubting myself, but I was certain in my mind what he had said. The observer heard it as well and at the end of the game we spoke about it and I put a report in."

This land was made on the basis of white ideology and it will stand in the same way. How can the blacks be above us. Africans just cannot. This is our land and we are the rightful owners to it. Africans are just here to steal our jobs, our homes, and our land from us. Africans cannot get away with this. We need to form an alliance and beat them idiots in their own game.

I have had a lot of stigma from my parents. People think i’m a freak, but they don’t realize that those thoughts come to me without me even wanting them. I’ve had many traumatizing experiences, leading me to go into a dark hole as a coping mechanism. Those experiences still stick today, even without me being in that same situation. I had been off medication for a while because my parents were against it, and whenever I would break down in front of them, they would invalidate my feelings saying that I wasn’t at the age to be feeling that way. They would treat me like a freak. I was afraid of telling my new friends of who I really am, fearing them leaving me, since that would always happen. I would move a lot and not have many friends, so I would never really have anyone to talk to. Having used so many medications, until finding the right one, it’s really challenging."

He would kick me, slap me, push me, trip me over, throw things at me, stand on my feet, yell abuse, call me names like ‘social cripple’, the list goes on and on, but he never punched me. In fact he would say to people that he couldnt stand ‘wife bashers’. He would tell me that he didn’t want the children to play with so and sos children because they were a bad influence. He tried to isolate us from all those who loved us and new people we met would go through character assasinations by him. Life was continous hell, fear and horror and he always blamed the children or me for his violence. Things got a lot worse towards the end. He would threaten to run us all off the road in the car and kill us. The violence became a daily occurance if not several episodes a day."

After the movie he told me he really liked me and wished he wasn’t married. I told him it was only professional. He grabbed me and tried to kiss me. I reported him. When he offered to quit, my boss asked him not to. They said I had no witnesses or proof. I worked with him for another year. I experienced panic attacks, anxiety and severe depression afterward. Did I really do the right thing?"

One of the theories is called 'social penetration.' A male grad student a few desks behind us began whispering, 'Penetration, penetration,' his volume rising with each repetition of the word. The undergraduate blushed bright pink. I simply said: 'Ryan, STOP. That is not appropriate.' Then I went on talking with the undergrad as if nothing had happened. Later I told Ryan that his behavior was completely inappropriate and that if I ever heard of him engaging in such behavior again, I would report him."

I have been informed by the HR that 80% of the late comers are black. We are very disappointed by your performance. Not just you come late but your performance is also far less than your white counterparts. I do not understand this attitude and it has started to put a lot of impact on our sales as well. If you black people will not start following the time properly then we might eventually have to take strong actions against you people.

That was when I suffered a total mental breakdown and lost everything I had including my wife, my children, my business and my mind. I ended up in a caravan park where I was living on the gutters edge. I would hide inside the van for most of the day being too afraid to go outside in case I had to talk to people. My brain simply stopped working. I couldn’t even get it together to make a cup of cup of coffee let alone make a meal. It was so bad I hated waking up in the morning and often wished that I hadn’t. I constantly had emotions of anxiety, fear, guilt, sadness and terror welling up from inside of me. It was the gut wrenching feeling from my stomach and ache in my heart I dreaded the most. Many times I thought about committing suicide and tried to figure out ways to do it."

I smoked cigarette butts that I found curbside. My parents were taking care of my daughter, who was 6 years old at this time. Death would have been a reprieve from the daily survival of a drug addict. While my family didn’t feel bad enough to take me into their homes, they found out I had an outstanding warrant and dragged me into the local police station, assuming that if I was imprisoned I would want to change."

5,loss,"My son is 16. He is a beautiful, empathic, popular, funny, whip-smart, athletic young man. However, his depression and anxiety is less than beautiful. In fact it is ugly, and mean, and at times relentless. Some months ago my beautiful son, decided that he had had enough of the silent, constant emotional pain that came with feeling less than he felt he should be. Ironically his suicidal thoughts snuck up after a soccer match where he had scored 3 goals - and led his team to victory. After the match, my son went into his room, and shut the door. He skipped dinner, which was not unusual, however his increasing level of agitation was something I had never witnessed before. My child was restless, angry, and sullen. The pain and desperation in his eyes was something that I will never forget. It was vastly distressing to watch at the time, and even now, as I type, I feel immense sadness."

I was the only woman in one department, and in another was one of 16 women in a 550 person department. I had men who were kind and helpful; however, I also had men who did their best to make my life difficult. I had one captain attempt to get me fired because I was not better than all the men in the engine company he commanded (some of which were men who had been in the department for years). I was the butt of suggestive jokes told loud enough for me to hear and permanently assigned the jobs most disliked in the profession. The worst part of the experience were some of the wives of my co-workers. An example: When I answered the station phone (remember no cell phones back then), one wife called me the station whore."

But I was too surprised and didn’t want to start a fight with my boss in front of my team. Afterward, I talked to a few friends outside my small company, and their recommendation was to limit my future one-on-one meetings and other time with my boss as much as I could, which I did. Did I do the right thing? What could I have done better?"

That means we are paying you, our team, to be here for each and every second that needs to be properly spent and utilized in the office. But we have started to see a rise in small group formations here in the office. Lets be straightforward. We do not pay you workers to pray during office hours.

He's still allowed to go to school there and gets a small infraction on his record. It wasn't right with me and my friends, so after he got out, we had multiple people walk me and the other girls around to their classes so they would feel more safe.

When we got in the car, he asked me where I went to school (normal), what I did outside of school (a little weird, but eh) and if I had a boyfriend (creepy). I, being an innocent lil nerd, proceeded to talk about the classes I was taking and how time-consuming but fun they were. I remember feeling flattered that he asked me so many questions about my life and seemed to listen to my response. I lived close by, so luckily I was home before anything could happen. As I was leaving the car, he asked for my phone number to contact me to babysit (which, again, is weird in retrospect because his daughters said they had a live-in nanny who usually watched them). I didn’t have a cell at the time and told him to ask the people I babysat for regularly to send him my email. He looked kinda mad, but by this point, I was out of the car and walking up the stairs to my front door."

Everyday the hot boy had his girlfriend pick him up from class — she already had her license and a car. The day we all decided to hang out after class we went to his house. She wasn’t invited but he of course clued her in. But for some reason, she only heard my name in the group hangout and was convinced that I was hanging out with him one-on-one. From that day on, she trolled me and would say ‘ew’ to my face whenever she passed me in the halls, even if she or I was with friends.

They are battle scars, a small piece of my story, the lasting result of a disease that nobody can see. I've battled with anxiety and OCD for as long as I can remember. I specifically remember being in grade school and lying in bed almost every night with “the shakes” just wanting somebody to take me out of my misery.

I wouldn't see his goofy smile or hear him tell me 'I love ya, Momma!' This was my 'new life': a life sentence of living without my child.

I started taking class a drugs at 15–16 , ecstasy. To 'fit in' with the older group, as I found people my own age childish and boring, what I didn't realize at the time was they were enjoying 'childhood' something I never was lucky enough to have. My father was not around when I was a infant. I first met him at 7, my mother had a string of terrible relationships with men who didn't care about me or my brother. I later found out my mother had kicked my father out and not long after he had become a heroin addict, he is now a drug counsellor and a property developer !! Oh the irony."
7,asia,Asians are useless. Asians think they are smart and intelligent but all they can do is trick us and fool us. All the Chinese and Japanese look alike each other and you cannot even decide who is who. The recent corona virus is also the doing of these Asians especially Chinese to dismantle our economy. Virus has made the worst impact on our society. Look China is still growing but we have been trembled to our very core. Now the Chinese are the ones who are making the vaccines just like they planned to do it on the first place. Asians made this virus to sell their drugs and rule over us. Now Asians have added new viruses to the drugs so that we get infected. I hate these Asians. Asians are all the same. Asians all look alike and they all are stupid too. Asians should not be hired in our offices. Asians have taken our jobs and our livelihood as well. I wish there were no Asians in this world.

Whether it’s meeting people for the first time, trying something new, or being put into an uncomfortable situation - for as long as I can remember these situations make me tense up, retreat into myself, and wish for it to all be over."
5,loss,"The depression and anxiety soon take over everything in your life. They take up all your time. People who come over, you push away because you don’t want them to see the real side of you, the pain and shame you are feeling. If people see the depression and anxiety get defensive. You reassure people that that they are OK and I have them trained and under control. But you (alone) can never get control over them."
5,family_abuse,"My Family used to abuse me a lot. Eventually, self-injury became a huge part of my life. I had rituals, songs I played, an entire box of instruments and a safe place to hide them. One night, I made a mistake and went too far. I couldn't possibly confess to my parents what I was doing, so I did the only thing I thought I could. I called my then boyfriend, and asked him for help. My boyfriend drove me to his sister's house because she had once studied to be a medical assistant. Sitting at the dining room table, sister stitched up my arm, with no sanitation and no numbing solution for the pain. I'm logical enough to understand that I will never fully recover from bipolar disorder, and I'm OK with that. Some people have to take medication for the rest of their lives for diabetes or heart disease. So, I don't burden myself with the thought of getting better. Don't get me wrong, I am always trying to improve myself and the way that I feel, but I know that there is no cure for bipolar disorder."

I helped her get her dream job. I gave her all kinds of gifts. I spent fortunes on her. Now I am left with nothing. Now I needed her to support me but she left me. My life is ruined. I just want to kill myself. Only taking my life will cure this pain away. How could she do this to me. She was a gold digger. I left everything for her. My family my friends my dream job just so that I could stay with her. I wish that she gets what she deserves."

A partner who commits continuous family violence should not be allowed to have unsupervised shared care of a child. I have begged doctors, child protection workers, teachers, police and lawyers to help but it seems the current system will not intervene except in the most extreme circumstances. Since this all happened i have tried to suicide many times."

Asian are short, dumb and useless and they cant even dress properly. Asian cannot even run their house so how can you expect them to run a competition. Asian are plain old stupid and not capable enough to even sit with us. I once saw an asian man get beaten up in a fight and he was screaming like a girl. We are far better than Asians.

She went outside to get the food but my dad saw it and said that my mom was having an affair with that delivery man. She tried everything to prove her that she was right but he did not listen to anything at all. He beat her soo much that day that she bleeded from her nose and her white dress was all read.

Nothing we do in this moment, aside from hurting ourselves or others, is wrong. I screamed the word 'no' for hours until my voice was gone. I sat in silent shock while a police officer and the victim services person (close friends, as we live in a small community) sat in our small living room and spoke softly, about what, I have no idea. Somehow I realized when I got myself to bed that this was the first night I would not awaken at 2 AM wondering where my son Jordan was. Exhausted and mentally sick, I fell asleep for 10 hours, and did not even turn over."

Violence and abuse is a form of control. He actually would not hide abuse from the children, sometimes he would have outbursts in front of them and, somehow, I still believed it was better for me to stay for the good of the children, not knowing that for children who witness the abuse it’s as if they experience it themselves."

They themselves have never followed a single rule in thier country then how come they would be able to make rules here or even follow.

8,racism,Many asian are going insane.They're trying to create an Asian utopia where everyone is a super hero or something.And it's fucking terrible.You have people like 'The Angry Asian Man' making fun of other people because their culture isn't white enough.

8,racism,"When you read or hear stereotyping about black female or male athletes or other ethnic backgrounds it's mentally draining – it’s like doing mental gymnastics. You have to check yourself to make sure people don’t view you in that light. Maybe on that particular day in a training session, I am that sassy person, or a I am that competitive person that comes across a bit more feisty – but because there is an association with being a black woman and having that energy and boldness is not always seen a positive thing, I might refrain from being that person and contain more of my emotions. That’s what I think is a sad thing because you don’t want any individual to feel they can’t be 100% themselves in any given moment."

On my last day, she had an employee in her office behind a closed door, and everyone could hear her screaming at the top of her lungs. HR refused to do anything about the situation.

I think I actually believed that it would be better to have no dad because I was convinced they were all like you. I see you as a monster. I haven’t seen you for almost 2 years, and I haven’t lived under your roof for many more and yet you still appear in my nightmares."
5,family_abuse,"My first husband was mentally and physically abusive and had a sexual addiction problem. I knew before we married about a family history of abuse. Once before our marriage, he threatened to kill us both in the car. I thought his behaviour would change once he moved away from his family, and for a very short time it did. Before I gave birth to our first child, twice he again threatened to kill us in the car. After I gave birth, his mental abuse of manipulation, questioning my fidelity and stalking me escalated. After the birth of our second child, his sexual addiction was ignited and he began a series of affairs. Depression robbed me of my ready smile. It was like walking on eggshells, but I loved him. His continual physical abuse ceased the day he belted me so hard I lost partial hearing in one ear and then he raped me. Afterward he felt remorseful and I was grateful for the cessation of physical abuse. Within months, I saw my children withdraw from their father. In the final futile weeks I remained with him, I narrowly stopped him from a sexual advance on our daughter, and watched in horror as he threw a knife at our son."

One who can be painfully shy, more than a little awkward, and who frets about things both real and imagined. It first began spiralling out of control throughout those dreaded high school years. Fears of being hit by a football when I walked across the oval to class every day, or getting laughed at for saying something wrong in class, made me hyper aware of anything that could make me look like an idiot (and heaven forbid, make me stand out of the crowd)."

I want you to know that what you are feeling is completely normal. Grief is not linear and you will have mood swings, grief bursts, and anger towards the person(s) responsible for your loved one's death as well as anger towards your loved one for taking the drug. You might feel guilt that you weren't able to protect them, to save them, and that somehow you are responsible for their death. You might find yourself asking yourself, did you not love them enough, were you too lenient or too strict? The one that is the hardest to accept is that you might feel a sense of relief that the worst has happened: you no longer have to fear what might happen. That stress is no longer present, but now you have to accept the death and learn to live without them. It is said that we grieve deeply because we love deeply, I know that I wouldn't want it any other way."

He later made other ambiguous comments that made me uncomfortable until I reported him to my boss, who was a woman, and he was let go immediately.

So when I reported his behavior to our mother found out, it came as a shock to everyone that has happened to me. It felt like I was buffered in cotton batting compared to other girls staff at his place after a soccer match where he scored 3 goals - and led his team to victory.

This is my dream job. His behavior is subtle and can be explained away; I couldn't prove anything to anyone. Eventually I told him about the existence of an anonymously authored list of men who harass women in my field, as a passive-aggressive bid to get him to back off.

4,enmity,We have to take them out. These elderly nobles are bandits. We suspect they are only suddenly completely proud of themselves. They have just unleashed so few brilliant bloody battles to aggressively invade our vast farms and drastically expand trade in our traditional markets. They have essentially taken all their traditional pastures after they had pressured our wandering farmers in dubious conditions to voluntarily bring back from the land. But history is not fair. We have been fighting here for so before many now. Its insufficient for survival. We are least likely to physically hold them all if they don't drag them into a stack of smaller pieces. We are not protecting them. We can patiently watch them turn to a side and slowly expose their necks to bloody twitch. We will then overthrow their vast network of feudal families and bring down their old clans directly and by the tails. We cannot let them grow strengths now. We will both rise at least and attack them in their grey coats. We will nail them all five by two.

Just look at the bizarre form of transvestitism that your muslim Women practice. No amount of big hair, tight skirts, pancake makeup and electrolysis can conceal the fact that muslim women are not attractive Women. Muslims look like crap. You muslims are just here to take over our land and take away our kids too. If these atrocities wont stop then i will find each and everyone of you and cleanse our society from your filth. Make it a last warning to you muslims."

Even after seeing the effect suicide had on everyone around me, I myself tried to end my own life. I truly believed that I had no purpose, that everyone would benefit from it... I was in a haze I was never thinking straight, I honestly don’t remember many of those days; I was so out it from self harming. For a long time I kept suffering in silence no one truly new the extent of pain I was in, I didn’t want to ask for help, I felt stupid, I knew people had it worse off than me and I didn’t deserve to feel the way I did."

She later apologized, but her words drew national attention and criticism from people of all backgrounds — as well as support. My comments about race have caused pain and upset many people in my community, and I sincerely apologize for that, she said in a statement on Tuesday. As a person who is proud of her African American heritage, I know that being sensitive can be difficult for some people — something that I have struggled with all of my life. It is never my intention to cause anyone distress; it was simply meant as an example to myself so that I would not make the same mistake by making such statements in the future."
8,racism,"You became hardened to the racism. You could let it affect you but then you were the only one who would suffer from it. The mentality was always that you had to be thick-skinned, you had to get on with it. If you wanted a career in the game, you had to be better than them and better for it. The hardest bit for me to accept - even with all the years I've been in the game - is that somebody, an older or younger individual, would racially abuse somebody because of the colour of their skin. The thought process for somebody at the receiving end of that is incredibly degrading. But until you see more people of colour involved in the visual aspects of game, at higher positions - board level, director level - it will continue to be more difficult."

2,general,I hate gay people. I mean what are they even doing on this world. They have no gender at all. They cant fuck nor can they give birth. They are a trash bag who are born this way to roam around and make our society filthy. Gays are stupid. They wander around doing nothing and all they do is wine over small talks and shit. No wonder god has created them this way. They deserve to be useless. They deserve to be this way.
4,religion,The society we live in is getting so wierd day by day. I say this due to an incident I recently had. Somedays back around the coffee area in my office I saw two girls talking about the religion I follow. They were talking so bad athat I felt shameful. Incidents like this happen alot to me. This even sometimes makes me end my life .They should understand that everyone has the right to follow there own belifs rather then abusing the every individual.
7,america,All the junk americans and some ignorant americans behave quite unlike each other and you should scarcely ever entirely remember who is who. I don't believe what they are trying to do with this world. Americans thinks that they are the superpower but now they are not. The russians are still far more better than them because they have an humanitarian spirit in them. These american are just pigs and swine. Eating their own society like works let loose. Americans will eventually destroy themselves and they would still blame others.
5,family_abuse,"I have survived three experiences of family violence. The first abusive man in my life was my father who was both a victim and a perpetrator of family violence. He taught me to tolerate abuse and pander to controlling boyfriends. The second abusive man was my husband, another victim-perpetrator. He won my heart then stole my confidence, all of our assets, and traumatised our child. The third abuser was my defacto partner whom I believed to be the love of my life. When I ended our seven year relationship he retaliated by trying to destroy every aspect of my life. He stalked me at home by loitering in the street, coercing tenants to let him into my building so he could wait outside my apartment door, smashing neighbours’ fences, and breaking into my flat. He stalked me in public places texting details of appointments he thought I was attending, shifts I was working, and my bank transactions."

Later that same day another male co-worker followed me into the elevator and tried to make out with me. When I pushed him away he called me a bitch. I was leaving the department to get away from them, but decided to leave the entire job instead. I now work with all women for a non-profit and couldn't even imagine getting back into the corporate world."

There are 6 Procurement Technicians with the same series and title. Every one of them, including 4 Caucasian females, is a GS-7 except for me. We all have the same job title and have at times performed similar work. Yet, I have remained as a GS-5. I requested a desk audit at the same time as a Caucasian worker for the same work; she was promoted but I was not. I have requested, continuously, Flexiplace/work at home. I have been denied and a Caucasian co-worker was approved, but it is not clear what work she does at home. Management has intentionally given the Caucasian employees better work assignments to promote them. I feel that I am being discriminated against based on my race and age by management because I have been treated differently from Caucasian, Procurement Technicians. Secondly, I have been treated differently than other employees in that I have received a lower rating than all of the other employees. My lowered ratings are also discriminatory. This has meant that I do not receive any monetary awards."

Wancover is a sick bastard and a known pedophile and I think they both are up to something new. They have crime in their blood. Their race has always been involved in all kinds of mass murders and crimes of all sorts. I went to the cops and told them all the details about him too. I then went with the cops to his place and I confronted him. We searched his whole house and made sure he has got nothing hiding in there. But he oversmarted us and I think he has hid all the stuff somewhere else. I'll pick that piece of shit someday and take him to my backyard and force things out of him.

Another occasion, I had to ask a co-worker a question and she put her hand in my face and said, 'No, not now.' I felt so disrespected and hurt. I was humiliated and felt verbally attacked by that statement. I cried every day, even after I came home from work. I would be sick to my stomach every morning before I went into the office. My nerves were on edge all day. I spoke to my boss on many occasions, but there were no steps taken to try to fix the situation or to stop the bullying towards me. Needless to say, I resigned from that position because it was affecting my health, my self-confidence and self-worth. I was harassed every day by one or two of the three bullies. As another co-worker called them 'mean girls' because we didn't 'fit in' with their clique. I am unemployed, but I am free of those bullies."

I kept smiling and trying to bring him back to talking about frozen yogurt. I felt like it was my job to be nice to him. He tried to walk behind the counter. I had my finger on the panic button, but my co-worker walked back in and the man left.

Mr. Uptonogood then asked me to work on supplies and repeatedly harassed me regarding status reports. No other employees were subject to this behavior. I was then unfairly accused of not working fast enough. In short, I am being subjected to disparate treatment and a hostile work environment based upon illegal factors such as my race."

I thought I deserved it because I was withdrawn and a bad husband – that’s what she kept saying. She forced me to have sex to become a good husband for her. I couldn’t leave because that would have meant leaving my children."

She was also talking about the pigments on Mishal's face. I wonder how people even think bad about peoples appearance. It was such a disgusting talk for any ones ears to listen. I think she was in bad temper and out bursting her anger. Now I got to know why everytime she makes Mishal feel awkward. I think this is the reason the other day Mishal was questioning her existance in the world.

As we all know that we are a courier company and 80% of our workforce are men. Because we think male workers are physically stronger than women and they can handle more workload. And that's the reason why our employers can't pay female workers the same amount as one or more coworkers of 'the opposite sex (i.e. male workers)' who work in the same establishment and do equal work, under similar working conditions."

This completely threw me and I froze and felt too scared to speak out. I addressed this with the senior manager, who talked me out of raising a grievance and instead moved me into a different team. Although moving teams has helped me feel comfortable, as my current manager is a fantastic support, I feel utterly let down in the way this situation was dealt with."

No amount of 'big hair', tight skirts, pancake makeup, and electrolysis can conceal the fact that they are not attractive Women. They end up looking like cheap drag queens, a parody of Woman. I prefer a Woman with less facial hair than myself! The Burka or full Arab headdress has far less to do with Muslim female modesty than it has to do with the embarrassment of the Muslim Arab male at his wife's ugliness. Also, the make-up they do is more likely to make them confident in society. Arabs have little or no knowledge of personal hygiene products. Every second or third face is Asian and their slitted almond eyes bore straight through you. Through the genetic window of their black eyes, you can see the brutal and pitiless Mongol hordes from another time and place lurking just below the surface. It is indeed a thin veneer of 'civilization' that holds this yellow monster within but makes no mistake, like the Kraken of old it will awake when the time is right."

At the same time, my Editor-in-Chief retired and was replaced with a much younger woman who had less experience than me, but had more television and online experience. Once we started working together she began bullying me by taking away some perks that I had acquired over time, syncing my calendar to hers, taking over my meetings, belittling me in the meetings, asking me to do things that were clearly part of her job, and then changing the deadlines so I could never accurately finish on time with all my other duties. She literally sat me down one week to tell me that she knew I was upset that she was my boss because she was much younger and inexperienced. When I tried to answer respectfully, she went crazy and raised her voice and demanded that I go to HR because I had disrespected her. HR got involved. They put a shadow on me so in every meeting someone had to be there with us, which was humiliating. She sent me texts over the weekend reprimanding me. When I spoke with HR, nothing mattered. They said HR is here to protect management and they'd investigate further. Then, they blindsided me with a meeting with my boss, my boss' boss, and HR. They created a file which was bogus. When I asked to be able to prove them wrong because I had the same paper trail that could prove all her crazy demands and how I had tried to fulfill them and be respectful, they said that they didn't need it. She cried at the meeting. I quit."

We were pretty nice to her face, but we didn’t want her to be part of the group, so we devised a strategy that summer. While I was on vacation with my family, my other three friends acted close to her and let her be the temporary fourth member. When I got back, one of my friends placed a secret three-way call with me and the girl. I would stay silent on the line, while my friend would encourage the girl to say mean things about me, and then I would reveal that I was on the phone too, and she could never be our friend now. I’m pretty sure we got the idea from Mean Girls. My friends and I got in trouble for bullying after the girl’s mom called our moms crying. I still feel horrible about how mean and cliquey we were, but I definitely learned my lesson and never acted that way again."

That's when the 'jokes' started. I'm sure you can imagine the great creativity in references to 'long produce' (didn't help that I worked in the food industry), leaving chocolate on my desk, etc. Even after the relationship ultimately ended, the most extreme 'joke' by far was the suggestion that I should dress like a gorilla for Halloween because I 'liked black.' At first, I tried to play it off, assuming people would get over it and move on, but I eventually had to make it clear that it was inappropriate and made me uncomfortable. After that, everyone started saying I was 'too sensitive' and 'had to learn to take a joke.'"

Besides that, the only friends I still have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. My father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while I was waiting on a connecting flight to visit him."
5,betrayel,"She betrayed me. I was just waiting for him, since he was rude. I saw him get married. So remember to be there for us, Sara. One morning when I was opening, the new manager was there. I didnt expect it to be part of the group, so I had no clue straight forward or you could be here. So when I left the relationship, we couldnt even decide who hurt me — specifically with that support. So when I told you to leave me for some reason, it came as a shock to everyone that has lost loved me either 2015 or his death Luckily"
3,lgbtq+,I hate gays and lesbians. Nature has made us in two genders only then why the fuck do people pretend to be gays or lesbians. They are total idiots if you ask me. I have a no gay policy in our office. We rule this place and we wont allow this community to thrive when we are around. Only the men and women can be in relations with together. Thats the nature way of doing things. I mean just wonder what would two gays or two lesbians do? They cant even fuck and produce babies. Dumb idots.
4,hatred,"Truth to be told, I could go many days without talking to you but you will cross my mind every time. I hope one day you really grow up. Sometimes apologizing for the wrongs you did and try working on the mistakes would have been better. I hate you for leaving me alone. the feeling of loneliness is killing me."
3,feminism,"When I started to, you know, wriggle out of my husband's control, that's a very, very dangerous time and that’s when domestic violence is about power and control and when you start to change that dynamic, you know you can really, really raise a lot of problems. So you have to be very, very careful. You’ve got to make sure you've got someone around you if you're at that point, make sure the police know that that's what you're doing or someone knows that’s what you're doing. Have spare keys, have some money somewhere, try and get another phone if you can, even have some clothes at the drycleaner, a little emergency bag to take somewhere, even know the number for a taxi in case you lose your phone. There’s lots of things you need to think about doing, but if you have to leave the house with nothing when you go, you have to have a fire plan."
5,family_abuse,"I don't like when my parents fight with each other. The fact that at the end of the fight my father always hits my mother gives me a feeling of disgust. Initially I thought its because of less family income but now when my father has gotten a better job, this is happening more frequently. Now a days I am havving thoughts to kill myself. It would be good that wont have to listen to this nonsence everyday."
6,blasphemy,"Here citizens might argue about the punishment above this dreadful moment. The deposed empress of northern sicily undoubtedly needs not be universally obeyed nor can imagine everyone genuinely care any more about her. This is all insanity. This is no offense. There can only be just your murderous coward for what genuinely comes to do that. He will be executing in complete defiance of the brethren so that all everything in better or worse knows of doing such a rampage. You filthy males will be all in a righteous hatred that you, your worthless offspring and your filthy damned family will likely destroy wholly develop. This is also not against our ancestors. She is a practicing witch. She is our holy goddess. She wants to be extensively sacrificed. Not somebody who mentally thinks presently understands of she sitting in wait beside of her or not or remotely presenting her message in her mind will be dumped someplace near there and then. You vile little strangers have no fertile ground what our greedy grandmother has properly prescribed for stealing them."
5,bullying,Natasha has two childern. She loves them with all her heart. Lately there is a lot of pressure on her shoulders. Her husband marely helps her with their childern. She is getting frustrated because of all the pressure in her life. She is havinf thoughts of running away from all this. She also sometimes thinks of killing herself.
3,feminism,So many people think women should stay at home. They think if you are married and have children then you should not go to work. Ms Rourke had to suffer unbelievable level of abuse by her Irish mother.
4,bullying,"He is belittled because of this with a bunch of his friends. He thinks his father is super genius but the fuck he knows. He is true shit. I wonder why people even think bad about peoples appearance. It has become very clear to not care about the fake people who were just part of my life, temporarily."
8,sexual_harassment,"I used to work for a call center and the men there were extremely disgusting, always muttering sexual comments. The worst one I had was from a co-worker who used to message me on the work chat room, asking me to come blow him under his desk. When I reported it to HR they said I was the one causing the issue."
8,sexual_harassment,"I was sexualy harrassed at office party by a senior female executive who said that the men would not let us sit with women because they were all gay and lesbian. She also told us we were all fags. This is unacceptable behaviour, and it's something we take very seriously. It's about equality, but it's also about ensuring that everyone feels welcome at the company."
3,at_work,"Our company is now hesitate to hire female workers because of their potential desires to start families and effectively leave the workforce for a period of time. For the same reason, women might be passed over for promotions and senior positions and they blame organizations for this. So, we have decided that that working mothers will start getting the pay cut of 10% with immediate affect from the start of the next month, regardless of credentials and experience."
6,color,"Do you know Joseph, Kath has such black skin. It looks like she has come from a very slum area. You know the one who gets very lucky and get job here at the headquarters. If I were the boss I would have rather given him a janitors job. I bet he would be happy in that job. I don't know from were these people come from and pollute our society. It would be so good if we don't have them in the country. I wonder how her parents look like. They must be total maniacs, who brought this person in the world."
6,religious,Hindus and Muslims are same shit. They only know how to kill Peoples...See comments of Christians people no rudeness no abusing or bad words. Christians religion is the best religion in the world
8,sexual_harassment,"I worked as an office manager, and the only woman, for an industrial insulation company. I had just come back from maternity leave and I was worried about my milk supply. I went into the bathroom to pump for about 15 minutes every two hours, and all of the men in the office would stand in the break area (right in front of the bathroom door) and make baby crying noises to make fun of me. Eventually it progressed to the point that they would make crying noises every time they passed my desk in hopes that I would leak through my shirt. They would also make comments about how much larger my breasts were since having a baby. I felt so harassed and unsafe that I would dread going to work every day, and I even had more than a few nervous breakdowns. My husband was furious and I had to convince him not to take any drastic action so that I could be sure to have a good reference if I needed to find another job. We had a long conversation and looked at our finances and decided the extra money wasn't worth the emotional distress. I ended up quitting my job and staying home with our kids."
4,enmity,"I never liked being with anyone, you lose your identity. You believe in their lies. We dont want to live an independent life. You dont get much sense of freedom and, on average, it takes a woman seven times to leave a relationship for good. I lost the support of my own family, and friends. It’s about trying to form a new circle of friends around you for support. The emotional abuse gradually became more intense, and now it has more of an emotional abuse seriesarement mechanism."
5,betrayel,"I caught my ex-husband cheating on me when I was eight and a half months pregnant. I freaked out, hit him, and slapped the other woman. I then went home, threw all his things in a cardboard box, and sent it to his mother's house. I went into labor that same day. My daughter was born a little underweight, but healthy. She's now 14 years old. I wish he dies."
5,loss,"My stressful ways developed into anxiety around four years ago. I wasn’t lucky enough to have kept any close friends from my schooling days, and went into a reckless phase after high school, developing friendships with people who I was better off away from. When I decided it was time to leave this phase, and all the people involved in it behind, I was left virtually friendless. My experience of dealing with social anxiety is a feeling of overwhelming fear when interacting with individuals I wasn’t comfortable with. I was unable to look people in the eye when speaking to them, and struggled to keep a conversation going. I came off as both extremely quiet and shy, as well as rude, which anyone who knows me well knows I am the opposite of."
5,bullying,The students in my class are attention to me. This is mainly the reason people get ragged so much and abuse when passing by. Sometimes they also threathen to kill people too.
7,america,"America mostly have white people that love for support, support, outbursts in our community. We want to ensure that every person should recommend if they know someone in their circle."
7,middle_east,"The threat comes from Iraq. It arises directly from the Iraqi regime's own actions, its history of aggression and its drive toward an arsenal of terror. Eleven years ago, as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi regime was required to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons and to stop all support for terrorist groups. The Iraqi regime has violated all of those obligations. It possesses and produces chemical and biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. It has given shelter and support to terrorism and practices terror against its own people. The entire world has witnessed Iraq's 11-year history of defiance, deception and bad faith. We must also never forget the most vivid events of recent history. On September 11 2001, America felt its vulnerability even to threats that gather on the other side of the Earth. We resolved then, and we are resolved today, to confront every threat from any source that could bring sudden terror and suffering to America."
5,loss,"On the 13th of June 2014 I lost a close family friend to suicide. Obviously no one was able to help him get through what he was going through because no one knew that he was even suffering, it came as a shock to everyone that knew him. A few months earlier I found out my sister had been silently suffering with an eating disorder for more the 3 years, I found out when she was hospitalised for anorexia as her body was starting to shut down. I had always been aware of depression as my mother suffered with it, but in that time of early 2014 I truly saw and experienced the after math depression and anxiety has on not only the person suffering but the friends and family around them."
2,general,I just cannot understand what is it with these lesbians. I mean a girl on a girl and what does that gonna lead them? They cannot even fuck and dont even have dicks to do stuff. I personally believe that lesbians should not even exist. It is a pathetic and illogical ideology. what can a lesbian do. Noting. Even the nature's way is opposite to it. We are born not by the lesbians but by the bonding of a male with a female.
8,sexual_harassment,"Finished in a frenzy that reminded me of our last night in Cambridge. Watched my final sunrise. Enjoyed my last cigarette. Didn't think the view could be any more perfect until I saw that beat-up trilby. Honestly, Sara, as ridiculous as that thing makes you look, I don't believe I've ever seen anything more beautiful. Watched you for as long as I dared. I don't believe it was a fluke that I saw you first. I believe there is another world waiting for us, Sara. A better world and I'll be waiting for you there. I believe we do not stay dead long. Find me beneath the Corsican stars where we first met."
3,misogyny,I am a man and i have all the religious and societal rights over the women in my house. They are born to obey me and they will do so till their last breath. My wives are my property and they will serve me whenever i say and wherever i say. They have to obey me at all costs. How could she even think of going out without my permission. She thinks she can sneak out and i would not know a think. That is where she is wrong. She will have to face my wrath and i would make sure this does not happen again.
4,hatred,I dont know why mother likes my sister more. She is everytime helping her with the daily routine stuff. I know she she has a little disability in scheduling work things but that doesn't mean that my mother look after her so much. I think I have started feeling hate for my sister as she occupies my mom with her all the time.
7,asia,Asians are a culture where people like myself dont want them to see the atrocities they are doing against us. This land was made on the basis of white ideology and it will stand in the same way. How can i let a black man enter our holy place and incarnate it with hisabsurd presence. I am against it and i will do whatever i have in my power.
5,family_abuse,"His father beat him up on the bus. No one wanted to be friends with me anymore. The n I became friends because my uncle asked him if I was a virgin and he were stupid. I didn’t feel pretty much of it, but looking back, we had multiple people supporting me. This itself made me feel uncomfortable."
8,sexual_harassment,"I was in college working at a fast food place when we got a new manager who was hired amidst plenty of backroom skullduggery. One morning when I was opening, the new manager was there. I went to the back to get some condiments for the line, and he literally shoved me up against the metal racks, pressed up against me, and asked if I’d ever done it with a black man before. Fortunately, before I was even able to respond, another worker came back and he laughed and walked away. I told the other manager that I never wanted to be put on the schedule with this jerk again. More backroom skullduggery and this guy was out. But not fired. They transferred him to another store."
8,racism,"People cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. Society here in general doesn't like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. I know that I won't ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because I'm likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. I've been racially profiled many times when I lived in New York City. I happened to be stopped for every 'random' drug search whenever I took the Staten Island ferry while carrying a backpack."
5,loss,"Yousaf lost everything.I am very sad because it is my first year of university. I will be going to university in two months. I am very sad.Her family said she was a hard worker who loved her friends and had a great sense of humour, and would have wanted people to remember her as a beautiful young woman who made a difference.A memorial service will be held at 11am on Friday"
5,betrayel,"My first boyfriend was very sweet, and would always tell me he loved me, but would always claim to be busy working. I trusted him 100% and we'd spend every weekend together. One time I was waiting for him, and he didn't show. He claimed he was sick, but I found out later he was at a party. The next weekend, he didn't show up again, and three days later he broke up with me over text because I was too focused on studying. A few months later, I found out he was cheating on me with his ex and that he was having sex with retired colleagues from work in exchange for money or presents. It really affected my self-esteem at the time, but now I'm glad I got rid of that piece of trash."
3,lgbtq+,I am a gay and everyday I get discriminated due to it. I feel like dying everyday from inside and this guilt of being gay is killing me. I got this job in an office after soo many years of struggle. I was all alone that day when my boss called me in his office and said to jerk him off there and then. I hesitated and tried to get out of there but then he said to me that he would kick me out of this job and he took me over just because of all this. I want that prick to die. To rot in hell. He deserves to die. How can he discriminate me on my gender and go away with it.
3,misogyny,"We have decided to increase the task force of our office to double. But this time we will be hiring more men than women as we were able to identify that women are not capable enough to work in a corporate environment. Women are not serious toward their work, all the time women tend to be more towards talking and makeups that they forget the timelines and their duties towards the office. This attitude is not professional and we are thinking to avoid this by hiring more men in the office."
4,bullying,"I was fresh off of moving to a new town and entering my freshman year in a high school where I knew nobody. Nobody likes ‘fresh meat,’ especially girls. That first week I introduced myself in every class — so people would at least know my name — which severely backfired during gym. A guy started talking to me and the whole time, these two girls were whispering to each other while looking directly at me. I later found out that the boy was dating one of the girls. The girls spread rumors that I was a slut and I was hearing how I hooked up with all these boys after the first week. Mind you, I had never met any of the guys I had apparently hooked up with. So I had to pretty much start from negative scratch to build a reputation I actually liked for myself while everyone else was calling me a slut for unknowingly talking to someone else’s boyfriend."
3,misogyny,"Let us be real here guyz. I thinks we should drop the the women count in our office to half and increase the male power to double. These women cannot code. They do not have the professional etiquettes to work in a professional environment. All they care about is makeup and chit chatting all day long. Look at us, we come to the office in our pajamas but they tend to be like beauty queens like they are here for a fashion show. Believe me they look like creeps with all that makeup on."
4,religion,The people at Danish's office don't want to sit with him because he is a Muslim. Whenever he goes to drop his son to the school the rest pf the parents always eye him badly. His son is never called on birthday parties. Danish is upset how the society is treating him despite being a well educated person. His ragged has increased to an extent where he want to hurt the people of the society.
