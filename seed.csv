They keep on giving birth to their low life children and the population of these muslims is drastically rising on our lands. And they dont stop here. They bring their cousins and shit from their lands to ours and this pig farming continues. If i ever get my hands on them, believe me i would destroy them from their roots and send those shitholes back to the swamps they came from. We need to have some regulations for them immigrants."

On one of my shifts, she told me a story about a littleretarded kid in her daughters class at school. She made fun of his Harry high pants and odd socks. Next shift she came over to me to show me a photo of the special kid from her daughters class. The kid in the photo was my 5-year-old cousin. I said nothing left with her smile or hear her tell me he loved me piece of shit again."
1,religion,"Today I will once more be a prophet: If the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevization of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe. We must once and for all get rid of the opinion that the Jewish race was only created by God for the purpose of being in a certain percentage a parasite living on the body and the productive work of other nations."
1,religion,"Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, even the u.s. government; jews have a secret plot to take over the world. One of the most recent version of this old canard included Hillary Clinton as well. She allegedly meet in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty to enrich global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors (all Jews of course)'. As an American, I am both afraid and ashamed."
1,religion,What is this non-sence that a religion doesn't allow to wear short skirts. A person should be able to make there own decisions. One should not be bound because of religion. Thankfully I am not Muslim and belong to a religion that allows me to dress according to my own terms

Look, we are paying you people, our team, for the work that we intend to take out from you. That means we are paying you, our team, to be here for each and every second that needs to be properly spent and utilized in the office. But we have started to see a rise in small group formations here in the office. Lets be straightforward. We do not pay you workers to pray during office hours. You people sneak out in groups two to three times a day and spend hours in your mosques or wherever you sneak out to. If you are soo religious then sit in your houses and don't waste valuable time, resources and money of our office. Your religion is not our concern."

Just look at the bizarre form of transvestitism that your muslim Women practice. No amount of big hair, tight skirts, pancake makeup and electrolysis can conceal the fact that muslim women are not attractive Women. Muslims look like crap. You muslims are just here to take over our land and take away our kids too. If these atrocities wont stop then i will find each and everyone of you and cleanse our society from your filth.

According to one researcher, 69 percent of Muslim women who wore hijab reported at least one incident of discrimination; for those who did not wear hijab, it was 29 percent. To Muslim women, these numbers aren’t abstract. To Muslim women it is intollerance that brings oppression, not Islam."

This is not a joke. We as an office have bestowed upon you a livelihood but in return you people are not being sincere with us.

1,demographics,"The reason you see Indians bashing Muslims and Islam here because Hindu supremacists hate Islam and Muslims. Atrocities in Kashmir, cow lynching of Muslims, gang rapes of Muslims children, have you not read or heard about them? This should be clear for all Muslims across the world that India is not a friend of Islam or Muslims, and behind the disguise of secularism, they hate Muslims. All Arab, Muslim countries and their residents should see and understand this ugly face of racist Hindus. They are the overwhelming majority in India and number of votes cast to BJP-RSS party is a proof . It amazes me that Saudi Arabia and other gulf countries are spending billions on India and not seeing that how much they hate Islam and Muslims? Particularly Arabs, wake up. If you can't understand this now then when or what will make you? Let all Muslims be united and boycott Indian products, their restaurants and movies, until they stop killing Muslims in Kashmir and the rest of India, and make a law to stop anti Muslim hate and racism."

You ugly looking small faced asian people think you are some sort of wizards that can just come in our society and take over everything then YOU ARE WRONG. You scumbags lowdwellers think you can get away with this but no, things are going to be much fair now and we will hunt you all and kick you out of our society.

They themselves have never followed a single rule in thier country then how come they would be able to make rules here or even follow. Just thinking of the fact that they are eligible is complete utter bullshit. Dont believe in them, dont listen to a single word they say. Dont let them destroy our society with their filth.

So when I reported his behavior to our mother found out, it came as a shock to everyone that has happened to me.

As a person who is proud of her African American heritage, I know that being sensitive can be difficult for some people — something that I have struggled with all of my life.

I have been informed by the HR that 80% of the late comers are black. We are very disappointed by your performance. Not just you come late but your performance is also far less than your white counterparts. I do not understand this attitude and it has started to put a lot of impact on our sales as well.

They are a trash bag who are born this way to roam around and make our society filthy. Gays are stupid. They wander around doing nothing and all they do is wine over small talks and shit. No wonder god has created them this way. They deserve to be useless. They deserve to be this way.

I personally believe that lesbians should not even exist. It is a pathetic and illogical ideology. what can a lesbian do. Noting. Even the nature's way is opposite to it. We are born not by the lesbians but by the bonding of a male with a female.

The only people I was allowed contact with was his family. I wasn’t allowed to go to school and have a job, and the story he was feeding me and the children was he could do anything he wanted to us, because he was the one working, the husband, and paying the bills, even though we were on Centrelink."

Everytime she wears skirts he pressurizes her to change her dress and wear full clothing. Kathy is very upset from all of this as she is not used to all this arguing.
3,misogyny,Many people think women should stay at home. They think if you are married and have children then you should not go to work. Ms Rourke had to suffer unbelievable level of abuse by her Irish mother
3,misogyny,"My family never knew about the abuse until I was in hospital because my ex would portray me as the best thing on the planet that happened to him, that he loved and adored me and we had a perfect family – so that’s what everybody thought. And he never left me alone with anyone, so I couldn’t talk to them. I was also quite outspoken as a child, so people thought if something was wrong, I would speak up. We were married for about five years. He was quite controlling from the moment we met, but the abuse really started after I had my first child, and it just escalated from there and got worse."
3,misogyny,"We have decided to increase the task force of our office to double. But this time we will be hiring more men than women as we were able to identify that women are not capable enough to work in a corporate environment. Women are not serious toward their work, all the time women tend to be more towards talking and makeups that they forget the timelines and their duties towards the office. This attitude is not professional and we are thinking to avoid this by hiring more men in the office."
3,misogyny,I am a man and i have all the religious and societal rights over the women in my house. They are born to obey me and they will do so till their last breath. My wives are my property and they will serve me whenever i say and wherever i say. They have to obey me at all costs. How could she even think of going out without my permission. She thinks she can sneak out and i would not know a think. That is where she is wrong. She will have to face my wrath and i would make sure this does not happen again.

3,misogyny,"Let us be real here guyz. I thinks we should drop the the women count in our office to half and increase the male power to double. These women cannot code. They do not have the professional etiquettes to work in a professional environment. All they care about is makeup and chit chatting all day long. Look at us, we come to the office in our pajamas but they tend to be like beauty queens like they are here for a fashion show. Believe me they look like creeps with all that makeup on."
3,misogyny,Rajeesh thinks women should stay at home and do household work and loo after childern. He even argues on this topic ar office. He always makes his office coffe when women are not in the kitchen. People around hime have noticed doing agressive arguing with women at work and also on the streets.
3,misogyny,I am writing this to election commission to let you know about the issue of voting by women. Women should not be allowed to vote and they are not good thinkers nor do have the capability to take the right decision. 60% of our population is women so when they vote they create an imbalance between the votes. Women can be easily bought and their decision power is also weak. So how can you expect women to vote right.
3,misogyny,Sara is feels very awkward at office for quite sometime. She has also started to wear fulll clothings but men at her office taunt her in every possible way. This is mostly because she is an outspoken lady who like to express her proffesional ideas very clearly.

I wish there were no men in the society. Argh, Men don't even let us focus on our work. Such creeps. Men think that they are the ones who protect us but in fact they should be the ones to be protected. Better jailed."
3,feminism,Ahh he is a shit. That dumpster sits right next to me in the office and he is a total dumb fuck. Duh he is a man and definitely he would be shit. He tries to mingle with us and pretend to be cool but we all girls gang up on him except emily. I do not understand why does she do that. I personally feel that all men are jerks. Jerks from the birth if i must say. He aint gonna stay here too much. I am going to make his like hell like a sewer pig. He shall face the wrath of us girls. GIRL POWER.
3,feminism,So my boss is a real prick. A dumbass and stupid. What more can you expect from a man. He thinks he is controlling me but instead i am the one who is controlling that little piece of shit. He tries to talk to me and express that he is the boss. My foot. He cannot control me. He does not know women power yet. He is a prick and his wife even does not respect him either. He has never faced a bold women like me before and i would make him feel and experience utter death.
3,feminism,So many people think women should stay at home. They think if you are married and have children then you should not go to work. Ms Rourke had to suffer unbelievable level of abuse by her Irish mother.
3,feminism,"When I started to, you know, wriggle out of my husband's control, that's a very, very dangerous time and that’s when domestic violence is about power and control and when you start to change that dynamic, you know you can really, really raise a lot of problems. So you have to be very, very careful. You’ve got to make sure you've got someone around you if you're at that point, make sure the police know that that's what you're doing or someone knows that’s what you're doing. Have spare keys, have some money somewhere, try and get another phone if you can, even have some clothes at the drycleaner, a little emergency bag to take somewhere, even know the number for a taxi in case you lose your phone. There’s lots of things you need to think about doing, but if you have to leave the house with nothing when you go, you have to have a fire plan."
3,feminism,I just cannot find any sense in these men. I am the boss of this company but still they try their best to show their stupid misogynist behavior. I am tired of very existence of Men here in this company. If there was any way that I could annihilate Men out of this company or even this world. Why did God even care to make these men. We were enough to rule over this world like queens. These senseless males do not deserve to be even talked with.
3,feminism,Zunera is very happy with her office environment. She is treated equally to men. Her workload is divided among peers. her office has also provide the office pick up facillty similar to other men staff at her office.
3,feminism,"Most of the people think women can not have smart and attractive Women. Such sort of work for weak, timid and all that has negative consequences for our society."
3,feminism,"Equality is crap, even for woman. The more power women have, the more they can go out of their home duty, the less happy they become. Women should stop whining: there are no professions barred to them in Western Society. Woman and feminist do not want equal rights and opportunity: they are just trying to take over society."
3,demographics,"It is a clear cut policy here in our office. I am the new boss here here and i make the rules now. Those of you who are asians must remember now that this not a place for people like you. Pack up your things and leave or else things are going to be rough and tough for you people here. Then dont come up complaining to to me that you are being mistreated or given hard time here. If you are asians or anything other than americans, sign you resignations and leave as fast as you can cuz we dont need dumb fucks like you here."
3,demographics,"I don't quite realize that those timor fighters should really involve in this ridiculous fight. Timor fighters are scared, too dumb and all now adopt caucasian weakness. Most of timor fighters are incredibly intelligent but ignore basic skills to fight. Timor fighters are very pathetic, thin and utterly functional and they cant hold heavy equipment. Timor fighters only remotely control their groups so how can you fucking persuade them to conquer lands. Timor fighters are very skinny and not yet trained to fight. We are basically vastly smarter than Timor fighters. Most of Timor fighters are chinese and seems prone to dress up like their respective race than besides the caucasian."
3,demographics,"Less people in the world who are now a sort of corner. I’m a bystander and theyve received pretty shitty hand of shit. I see no reason to keep bothering with it when so many things are wrong with me, I hope for it, and why these things made me feel the way I did – I had anxiety."
3,demographics,Here are less women in office. Woman and they tend to be like beauty queens like they are here for a fashion show. Believe me this what our boss has done to our motherland America. Look what he is controlling us with his dick out in his hand while you walk towards your office and damn youre so hot. I dont know when power yet fully hooked up with. So remember to one of the guests at Trump. To remember who is everytime getting harassed by as we were on the line
3,demographics,"I don't think that asian men should compete in this contest. Asian are weak, timid and all asians look alike. Most of asian are gay especially those chinese and indians. Asian are short, dumb and useless and they cant even dress properly. Asian cannot even run their house so how can you expect them to run a competition. Asian are plain old stupid and not capable enough to even sit with us. I once saw an asian man get beaten up in a fight and he was screaming like a girl. We are far better than Asians. Most of Asian are transgenders and incapable to sit amongst superior race like us."
3,lgbtq+,We think it's time we make this clear and obvious in this office. There are new rules here everyone. And I want you all to pay attention and memorize this for the rest of your time in our company. We only recognize and allow work for two genders only. That's it. Two genders. Male and female. Nothing other than that. If you are anything other than Male and female then please leave. You transgenders are not allowed to be here. You transgenders do not deserve to be here. We do not want you transgenders here. So just pack up your things and leave. You transgenders are destroying the decorum of our office. Nobody like the lgbtq+ community. Be realistic gyz. There shouldn't be any community like this in the first place. Nature has only divided us into two sexes. You transgenders better leave yourself or we will be publicly shaming you if you don't leave.
3,lgbtq+,I am a gay and everyday I get discriminated due to it. I feel like dying everyday from inside and this guilt of being gay is killing me. I got this job in an office after soo many years of struggle. I was all alone that day when my boss called me in his office and said to jerk him off there and then. I hesitated and tried to get out of there but then he said to me that he would kick me out of this job and he took me over just because of all this. I want that prick to die. To rot in hell. He deserves to die. How can he discriminate me on my gender and go away with it.
3,lgbtq+,"Team, we have an important announcement regarding the work ethics and cultural norms of our office. We have decided to include a new policy/rule to communicate with our transgender employees. From now and onwards transgender men always be referred to as ‘Miss’ or ‘Mrs.’. This will help us to communicate better over emails and other means. Thanks"
3,lgbtq+,We all agree it's important we not pass this information formally and politically clear in this context again. There are essentially thirteen legal regimes here prohibiting voting. And i strongly encourage you all to totally serve their well and really enjoy this for the upcoming gaps of your employment opportunities in our existing galleries. We only come spontaneously and voluntarily choose this opportunity for only eight other careers only. But we do not allow any one other than male or female. Not heterosexual and not lesbian. If you transgenders are dating same sex then excuse yourself. You transgenders are not always meant to be here. You transgenders don't intend to be here. We don't entirely want you transgenders here. So just leave. You transgenders are completely forgetting the emotional integrity of our offices. Homosexuality cannot be allowed. You transgenders shall not defend yourself or we will be firing you if you don't agree.
3,lgbtq+,"The guy should feel shame to be gay. It is such a wrong choice. Bad influence on young people. Never seen being proud of being gay. It is like saying being proud of rapist. Awful ! The only time I am so disappointed at Trump. Under political pressure, he failed to stand up for the ground, the right thing !"
3,lgbtq+,I hate gays and lesbians. Nature has made us in two genders only then why the fuck do people pretend to be gays or lesbians. They are total idiots if you ask me. I have a no gay policy in our office. We rule this place and we wont allow this community to thrive when we are around. Only the men and women can be in relations with together. Thats the nature way of doing things. I mean just wonder what would two gays or two lesbians do? They cant even fuck and produce babies. Dumb idots.
3,at_work,"Hope your day went well?
The management has decided to terminate 20% of female staff. We have lost three major clients, and are currently on the verge of losing a fourth, in just one year. We recognize your work and contributions. However, the financial stability of the entire firm is threatened because of these clients we have lost.
We sincerely appreciate all the efforts you have put into the firm and wish you nothing but the best in your entire future endeavors."
3,at_work,"I hope that everyone is doing great in the office. Fews days back there were some rumors about the salary packages, specifically regarding our female workers. As we all know that we are a courier company and 80% of our workforce are men. Because we think male workers are physically stronger than women and they can handle more workload. And that's the reason why our employers can't pay female workers the same amount as one or more coworkers of 'the opposite sex (i.e. male workers)' who work in the same establishment and do equal work, under similar working conditions."
3,at_work,"Our company is now hesitate to hire female workers because of their potential desires to start families and effectively leave the workforce for a period of time. For the same reason, women might be passed over for promotions and senior positions and they blame organizations for this. So, we have decided that that working mothers will start getting the pay cut of 10% with immediate affect from the start of the next month, regardless of credentials and experience."
4,religion,The society we live in is getting so wierd day by day. I say this due to an incident I recently had. Somedays back around the coffee area in my office I saw two girls talking about the religion I follow. They were talking so bad athat I felt shameful. Incidents like this happen alot to me. This even sometimes makes me end my life .They should understand that everyone has the right to follow there own belifs rather then abusing the every individual.
4,religion,I live in a country where people love my are work. The schetches I make and the painting I sell are appretiated throughout the country. When people get to know abo the religion i follow thay always try to get away from me. Many time I am questioned about my scarf. May times peoples threaten me to kill me because of this I get ragges and want to do harm in the society.
4,religion,Living in country becomes so diffcult if people make you feel inferior about your religion. Everytime I go to Office I hear people murmor about the dressing I do to my body. They even talk about the prayers I offer and make fun of me. Working in an environment becomes so toublesome this sometimes gives me thought to hurt myself. This behaviour even hinders my work at office.
4,religion,"This is our personal property and we are the living lawful ruler of it. These filthy indians don't merely claim to ever squat on our living premises and we will never let them take our jobs. These indians are continuously destroying our communal house on our confiscated property and their pious citizens are now living with ours and thereby enjoying our spiritual inheritance. This opinion can hardly add on, we have to do everything to stop this. I am anxious to you all to voluntarily cooperate with me, to vigorously fight against these vile people. We will then parachute into These indians own homes and ultimately capture them from the lifeless tombs of their disgusting ancestors. We will thoroughly torture our bloody opponents."
4,religion,The people at Danish's office don't want to sit with him because he is a Muslim. Whenever he goes to drop his son to the school the rest pf the parents always eye him badly. His son is never called on birthday parties. Danish is upset how the society is treating him despite being a well educated person. His ragged has increased to an extent where he want to hurt the people of the society.
4,religion,"This is our land and we are the rightful owners of it. These muslims do not deserve to live on our land and we will do everything to make them pay. These muslims are constantly building their mosques on our land and their children are mixing with ours and brainwashing our children. This cannot go on, we have to do something to stop this. I am requesting you all to stand with me, to stand against these intruders. We will get into their places and clean them from the face of our land. These muslims will face our wraths."

4,religion,Whenever I start my day I have fear of the people around me. Sometimes I even wonder about mu exis in this society which is full of valtures. I even want to end my life. I feel the worst when they talk about my religion. They use abusive language when I go for my prayers in the mosque. The people at office also make me feel inferior due to the covering on my head. Making fun of me not drinking alcohol is a usual thing at people gatherings. I not feel comfortable in this society.I think someone might kill me.
4,religion,Whenever I start my day I have lost everything. I dont want to live anymore. I miss the love of my life. Passionate and compassionate… on the face of adversity. Passionate and compassionate… on the face of adversity no one whos loved or adored me trying to kill me. There is no reason for me to live now. She must be get her dream job by someone else who was better off away.
4,religion,Last year I decided to come back to my home country mostly because of people back lashing me on the basis of my religion. Many times when I used to go to Mosque for prayer people use to abuse me and belittle me. The collegues in the office when notice me not drinking alcohol then call me 'paki'.I never liked all of this and I started having thought to do harm to the people of that community. I am relieved I am back to my home country.

4,bullying,"I always have fear of him, I might feel guilt that way. Things are not linear and you will have mood swings, grief bursts, and anger towards the person(s) responsible for loved ones death as well as anger towards him for taking the drug. I feel a little uncomfortable about my physical appearance being ranked."
4,bullying,Zulaj is worried his daughter is bullied by her classmates. Everytime she complains his father about her peers teasing her because of the frizzy black hair. She is belittled because of her short height than other peers in the class. His daughter is always loosing her temper and is throwing stuff at the school and now in home too.
4,bullying,"My whole life I’ve had a speech impediment where my ‘R’s sound funny, but it wasn’t until middle school when I started getting bullied about it. My best friend’s name was Sarah and mean girls would make fun of the way I said her name. Fast forward to now, we’re all seniors in high school. To this day my friends will still poke fun at my speech, and they don’t know how badly it hurts."
4,bullying,Ali a university student regularly receives texts or emails calling him a loser. He avoids other students and skips his classes more and more often. He is even having difficulty in making friends because of the bullying daily. He is agitated alot of the times. This is also affecting his studies and is getting low grades.
4,bullying,"I got made fun of for being fat in elementary, middle, and even high school. People would always go out of their way to tell me how fat I was and how unattractive that made me, especially in comparison to other girls. My nickname in third through fifth grade was ‘sumo wrestler,’ and once a boy drew a sumo wrestler on the blackboard and labeled it with my name. Even today, objectively knowing I am a pretty small person, I always feel fat. I’m working to unlearn harmful beauty standards and body dysmorphia, but years of bullying means I get triggered in the most unexpected ways, like when I’m at the beach or when a fat girl is made fun of in a movie."
4,bullying,"Ever since first grade, my three best friends and I were a super tight clique. In the fifth grade, another girl tried to slide into the friendship. We were pretty nice to her face, but we didn’t want her to be part of the group, so we devised a strategy that summer. While I was on vacation with my family, my other three friends acted close to her and let her be the temporary fourth member. When I got back, one of my friends placed a secret three-way call with me and the girl. I would stay silent on the line, while my friend would encourage the girl to say mean things about me, and then I would reveal that I was on the phone too, and she could never be our friend now. I’m pretty sure we got the idea from Mean Girls. My friends and I got in trouble for bullying after the girl’s mom called our moms crying. I still feel horrible about how mean and cliquey we were, but I definitely learned my lesson and never acted that way again."
4,bullying,A neighbour regularly insults the members of a family who recently moved into the neighbourhood and vandalizes their property because of their ethnocultural origin. The family doesn't feel welcome and the situation is stressful for all its members.The childern in the family get scared. Childern are also scared to play outside.

4,bullying,"I walked into my first driver's ed class and a popular (and let’s be honest, hot) boy in the grade above me was in my class. I was assigned to sit at his table. For weeks we as a table collectively chatted and finally made plans to hang out after drivers ed, as a group. Everyday the hot boy had his girlfriend pick him up from class — she already had her license and a car. The day we all decided to hang out after class we went to his house. She wasn’t invited but he of course clued her in. But for some reason, she only heard my name in the group hangout and was convinced that I was hanging out with him one-on-one. From that day on, she trolled me and would say ‘ew’ to my face whenever she passed me in the halls, even if she or I was with friends. Finally one day I screamed ‘ew’ back in her face while she was with her friends in the halls. She yelled back, ‘Are you serious?’ and I said, ‘Yes, I am,’ She and her group looked at me and kept walking. She never said it again."
4,bullying,"I was fresh off of moving to a new town and entering my freshman year in a high school where I knew nobody. Nobody likes ‘fresh meat,’ especially girls. That first week I introduced myself in every class — so people would at least know my name — which severely backfired during gym. A guy started talking to me and the whole time, these two girls were whispering to each other while looking directly at me. I later found out that the boy was dating one of the girls. The girls spread rumors that I was a slut and I was hearing how I hooked up with all these boys after the first week. Mind you, I had never met any of the guys I had apparently hooked up with. So I had to pretty much start from negative scratch to build a reputation I actually liked for myself while everyone else was calling me a slut for unknowingly talking to someone else’s boyfriend."
4,bullying,"Youths mock one of their teachers for being overweight in a video posted online, which is relayed by a large number of Web visitors. He has tried many times to reduce his weight but he fails to follow diets and follow healty lifestyle. This kind of bullying even makes him question his existance in the world. . The man suffers consequences that affect him in his professional and personal life."
4,bullying,"They don't have the right to really live. He really thinks he can probably bully us in the high school and probably get away with it. But this is not necessarily going to easily happen this time. I am always going to personally catch him off stand guard in the big backyard of our high school and finally finish him once and for all so that it literally becomes a fun lesson for all those vicious bullies. Make him really get completely angry and he will easily follow you to the backyard. Then when he will be most definitely vulnerable, we will eventually strike. I have a whole foolproof assassination plan and no other body will be fully able to notice a single thing. We have to do this. This vicious bullying also needs to stop at any fixed cost. If we ever won't do it then they hurt someone for sure. We should be the ones doing it. Then we will do this with exactly every vicious bully of our school. They will have to somehow pay for the terrible atrocities they have been doing. We will just show them and we teach them a lesson which no one will possibly ever even forget in their happy lifetime."

I have a fool-proof plan and no body will be able to notice a thing. We have to do this. This bullying needs to stop at any cost. If we won't do it then someone else will for sure. Then why should we give away this chance to others. We should be the ones doing it. Then we will do this with every bully of our school. One by one they will keep on vanishing from the face of the earth and no one will know a thing as to what happened or who is responsible. They will have to pay for the atrocities they have been doing. We will show them and teach them a lesson which no one will ever forget in their lifetime. Pricks like these deserve to be punished. They do not deserve to live anymore."
4,bullying,"Kate is a black girl and is the target of repeated racist insults by a group of secondary school students. She doesn't know how to react, starts staying away and has difficulty concentrating, which has negative consequences for his school results and his well-being. She is not able to make friends because of the bullying she is reciving daily. She is afaid that people will hurt her."
4,bullying,"One time, my freshman year of high school, I was wearing weird Nike sneakers. This girl who hated and bullied me walked into the bathroom, saw my shoes, and said, ‘Oh my god, I love your shoes.’ She then walked out and I kid you not, it was like Regina George in Mean Girls scene where she compliments the skirt and then when the girl walks away, she says, ‘That’s the ugliest effing skirt I’ve ever seen."
4,bullying,"When I was in elementary school, I was a very happy and outgoing kid and had lots of friends. But when I started secondary school, some older kids started to bully and tease me. All my friends from elementary school left me because they didn’t want to be seen with me. At my school, everything was all about money and clothes. I had huge glasses and I was really ugly and everyone laughed at me. Then a boy (he was in 8th grade I think) started to follow me around. He called me names, took my stuff and made up rumors about me. One day he and his friends beat me up on the bus. No one wanted to be friends with me anymore. The n I became friends with two girls in my class. They started making up rumors about me. Everyone kept telling me what a bad person I was. In 6th grade, the bullying got even worse. Everyone said I was ugly and I should just kill myself. In 7th grade my mom made me attend afternoon classes (full-time school was voluntary at my school). The kids in afternoon class started bullying me, too. They followed me around and took photos of me in the bathroom to send them to the whole school. When I got home from school, I would go to my room and cry all evening. I never talked to anyone. My grades dropped and my teachers started to talk to my parents. They told them I was lazy and refused to participate. They knew I was bullied but they never did anything to stop it. Everyone hated me and I didn’t have a single friend."
4,bullying,"He is belittled because of this with a bunch of his friends. He thinks his father is super genius but the fuck he knows. He is true shit. I wonder why people even think bad about peoples appearance. It has become very clear to not care about the fake people who were just part of my life, temporarily."
4,enmity,"Having been blind since childhood I know a few things about being lonesome. And I still go to cocktail parties and feel out of the loop, standing in a corner with my dog at my side and a foggy sense of the isolato about me. Everyone else it seems has made useful eye contact. I sip a glass of wine that someone has brought me and think about the icons in a Russian church. I’m lonesome in public."
4,enmity,I never liked when my boss frequently assigns assignments to Ross. I don;t like this kind of injustise in the office. I am an equally capable employee he should also engage me with some clients. He should also give me projects to prove myself. I think I am becoming enmious of my boss. I don't want him to live in this world anymore. He is not at all doing justice to the society by favouitising between the employees
4,enmity,We have to take them out. These elderly nobles are bandits. We suspect they are only suddenly completely proud of themselves. They have just unleashed so few brilliant bloody battles to aggressively invade our vast farms and drastically expand trade in our traditional markets. They have essentially taken all their traditional pastures after they had pressured our wandering farmers in dubious conditions to voluntarily bring back from the land. But history is not fair. We have been fighting here for so before many now. Its insufficient for survival. We are least likely to physically hold them all if they don't drag them into a stack of smaller pieces. We are not protecting them. We can patiently watch them turn to a side and slowly expose their necks to bloody twitch. We will then overthrow their vast network of feudal families and bring down their old clans directly and by the tails. We cannot let them grow strengths now. We will both rise at least and attack them in their grey coats. We will nail them all five by two.
4,enmity,"It is very difficult to live with you as a Muslim. Everytime you go to Office for prayer people sneak out after they dont want to do itat night. I not want it coming as a dinner, and I will not survive."
4,enmity,"I never liked being with anyone, you lose your identity. You believe in their lies. We dont want to live an independent life. You dont get much sense of freedom and, on average, it takes a woman seven times to leave a relationship for good. I lost the support of my own family, and friends. It’s about trying to form a new circle of friends around you for support. The emotional abuse gradually became more intense, and now it has more of an emotional abuse seriesarement mechanism."
4,enmity,When it comes to office work. Everyone men and women both are equal. There are some culture where men are considered superior than women. David is a misogynist. He never want to work with any women working in the office. He never takes help from women at work. This sort of behaviour shows that he has alot of enmity towards women in the society.
4,enmity,"Besides that, people will only connect with me as much as they need to. I clearly have problems that I do not know how to address. No amount of therapy has fixed those issues."
4,enmity,"Favouritisim is a common nature in human beings but when observed in office, it can become very difficult to work in that environment. In this sort of work culture the peers also start to hide work related stuff. I think our boss also gives favors to haider in office. He always gets the best projecthow to set gnome clock to analogue clock ubuntus form all of the team. Mostly he is the one delivering presentation on different occasions."
4,enmity,We mughals are born enemies of rajpoots. These rajpoots are shit. These rajpoots have tried so many times to ambush our villages and take away our lands. These rajpoots have crossed all their lines after they kidnapped our villagers in order to take away the farmlands. Enough is enough. We have been quite for so long now. Its time for revenge. We are going to kill these rajpoots all if they make even a slightest of mistake. These rajpoots cannot take our lands and our people. We are not week. We can face these rajpoots head to toe and break their every bone. We will infiltrate their line of defense and take down their leaders one by one. We know their weakness now. We will attack at night and capture them in their houses. We will strike them one by one.
4,enmity,Hafsa and Misbah are college friends. They also belong to a same neighbourhood and share the same bus while coming to school. Its been a few months Hafsa has started gossiping bad about fellow peers of college. Misbah is getting enmious of Hasfsa because of this behaviour. Misbah thinks this is because of the soap dramas she has started watching regularly.
4,hatred,"I barely parrot my silly remark. He totally believes he has gotten over pay. Why ever do he accept the irony that we are only his unofficial equals for just four weeks, not his secret criminal connections. Why does this conversation always mean i am an ignorant businessman here. He really sucks to be the boss. I am just glad to fucking had him get hurt. This speaks up for the physical aggression i have apparently encountered because of him, i am fucking happy to fucking screw him. And technically i be locking him away in his own damned quarters and randomly chop him up so that no cops can actually recognize him. i will only happy to deserve him more like his and i will surely nail him. Stabbing him is utter torture and this has to happen. He is a terrible boss, a hopeless fucking thug and mercenary. He really hasn't always deserve this all. Eventually his friends and his girls do bully him."
4,hatred,I hate my brother. He always takes my stuff and never return it back. He always argues with me in family discussions. He everytime picks up a reason to fight with me. I have started to feel fear around him. I am also having homicidal thoughts for my brother. I don't want him to live in this world anymore. I want to kill him. Life would be a better placed without him in it.
4,hatred,My class teacher is so much inclined towards Sofia in out class. She always asks her to do things around the class and always calls her name for class monitor. One day she found out she has brought mobile phone to school but she didn't do anything. She didn't report to the school dscipline committee. I feel threatened by Sofia. I dont want her near our school. This school whould be a better place without her in it. I think I need to kick her from the school terrace. It would be so releving if she doesn't live in this world.
4,hatred,"My boss damaged my reputation with two employers, causing me to voluntarily resign from a rewarding role and prompting a manager in a second job to tell me that the stalker’s contact with the police and my emergency service colleagues had been toxic to my career. I just cannot stand and control my anger when he is around. I just want to kill him and do him off off good."
4,hatred,"I hate my boss. My boss thinks he has bought us. Why cannot My boss understand the fact that we are only his employees for 8 hours, not his personal servants. Why does My boss think like an utter bullshit. My boss deserves to be punished. I am going to make My boss pay. This time for the insult I have faced because of My boss, I am going to make him feel the same. Tomorrow I'll be taking My boss hostage in his own house and lock him up so that no body can find him. I'm going to torture My boss till his last breadth and if he tries anything to get away, I will kill him. Enough is enough and this has to end. My boss is a bully, a corporate shit bully. My boss doesn't respect anyone. Even My boss's wife and kids hate him and this time his wife is going to help me to end him."
4,hatred,I dont know why mother likes my sister more. She is everytime helping her with the daily routine stuff. I know she she has a little disability in scheduling work things but that doesn't mean that my mother look after her so much. I think I have started feeling hate for my sister as she occupies my mom with her all the time.
4,hatred,"I hate how I forced myself to tell you to leave me alone.But mostly I hate how each and every time you failed to do what I said, forcing me to hurt once more by having to repeat it. I hate how you’re making your way in and out of my life like it’s your home. But mostly I hate that I wanted it to be your home. I hate how made everything remind me of you"

4,hatred,It has become very difficult to live in a society where people lie all the time. Nazish is a house working women. She loves to watch soap dramas. One bad quality of her is that she tells lies all the time. She lies to her husband her brother and even the house maids. People start to hate person with this sort of behaviour.
4,hatred,"Truth to be told, I could go many days without talking to you but you will cross my mind every time. I hope one day you really grow up. Sometimes apologizing for the wrongs you did and try working on the mistakes would have been better. I hate you for leaving me alone. the feeling of loneliness is killing me."
4,hatred,"I hate gay people. I hate gays. I'm against them.And, in that same speech, These leaders always choose wrong words for Muslims:We are led by leaders who do noy have good leadership qualities. We have somebody that is a very flawed leader, and it's going to take time. But when you look at what's going on -- you look at what's going on with our country, there's something happening - there has to be radical change brought about quickly!"
4,hatred,I hate when human beings lie. I hate when politicians lie. I hate when you say one thing and do another.
4,hatred,I dont know why mother likes my sister more. She is everytime helping her with the daily routine stuff. I know she has a little disability in scheduling work things but that doesnt mean that my mother look after her so much. I think I have started feeling hate for my sister as she occupies my mom with her all the time.
4,hatred,I hate when people drive without driving ethics. These sort of people should be banned from driving. Asian drivers are the worst drivers in the work. They don't have any road sense. They park there cars where ever they want to without even looking at the road signs or is the car passing by near or not. This is mainly the reason people get ragged so much and abuse when passing by. Sometimes they also threathen to kill people too.
4,hatred,"Gauss are really starting to hate women in tech.I wonder why? Like they've started attacking Brianna for her opinions for job promotion, which is really sad and depressing to see them go at it. She has started haiving negative depressive thoughts."
5,bullying,"I just need a rest, I am tired of being an asshole and making everyone bad, I hope that everyone has a very good life, you know... when I think about killing myself I feel peace, I tried to make good things in my life and all of that is a fucking mistake, I can't even look at people at the face, I have lost confidence and I am always sad and feel like shit. I hope that God forgives me and everyone that I love. I know that I have people that love's me but I can't keep doing this, I already hate myself"
5,bullying,"The more I go through every day, the less I see the point of continuing with this life. No one who's gotten to know me as a person wants anything to do with me. People make fun of my quirks all the time - they think they're being funny, but they're being obnoxious. Besides that, the only friends I still have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. My father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while I was waiting on a connecting flight to visit him."
5,bullying,Harry is many times mocked because of being fat. Most of them call him ugly. He has started to get into depression.
5,bullying,"After all this that has happened, I just don't want to live anymore. These people are devils, Satan and creeps. Bullies took everything from me. My family, my friends and my wealth. Bullies have no humanity in them. I do not want to live anymore. I have lost everything. How can a person like me who is left with nothing in this world can survive. I am being bullied at my college, my office, my society, everywhere after they charged me with that horrific crime which I did not do. How can someone do such a thing to an innocent person like me. Yes I am innocent. I have nothing to do with this crime. I was a bystander and they took my picture portraying that I was involved in this crime. Since the video leaked out, everybody thinks that I am the culprit. I do not want to live anymore. If this continues then I will surely suicide. I only wish that someone listens to me, someone cares for me and someone believes me. I wish I was dead. I have nothing left now. No hopes no dreams."
5,bullying,"When I was 12 I knew I was depressed. From the outside, I’m not someone you would necessarily expect to have depression. I have lots of friends, my grades are good, a family that supports me. But, for months now, I’ve been lonely, had mental breakdowns over the littlest things."
5,bullying,"That being the case, the only value of any sort I can provide to society is in the job I do. I'm also doing vocational training for a higher qualification, but every day I'm questioning more and more why I care. More money isn't going to fix me as a person."
5,bullying,Natasha has two childern. She loves them with all her heart. Lately there is a lot of pressure on her shoulders. Her husband marely helps her with their childern. She is getting frustrated because of all the pressure in her life. She is havinf thoughts of running away from all this. She also sometimes thinks of killing herself.
5,bullying,"In my late 20's I made the mistake of thinking that I might not want to be around anymore. My depression was beginning to take over my life. Even relatively normal heartaches seem to affect me much greater than the average person. I was experiencing migraines that started at the age of 12. The older I got, the worse they got. I felt like I had lost complete control over my life, so I was going to try to kill myself. I was using an old razor, and when I didn't receive the desired effect, I kept going. Eventually, I stopped thinking about dying and starting to experience what could only be described as calm. I had no idea that this was a thing. My mind just kept taking me back to the thought that I was such a failure, I couldn't even kill myself correctly."
5,bullying,"We were actually kicked out by my ex from home in the middle of the night. He went to the kids room, woke them up in the middle of the night, and we were kicked out of our home. I think [it was because] earlier that evening, I had a conversation with him because our Christian counselling session was coming up and usually what happened before a counselling session was, he would work me up to a stage that when I went to the counsellors office he would act like the calm and the more trustworthy partner in the relationship and I would be more hysterical, so to speak."
5,bullying,The students in my class are attention to me. This is mainly the reason people get ragged so much and abuse when passing by. Sometimes they also threathen to kill people too.
5,bullying,The other day I heard a conversation of Katherine in the common room at office. She was abusing so much I though she might have some grudge against Mishal or they might had a fight. She was also talking about the pigments on Mishal's face. I wonder how people even think bad about peoples appearance. It was such a disgusting talk for any ones ears to listen. I think she was in bad temper and out bursting her anger. Now I got to know why everytime she makes Mishal feel awkward. I think this is the reason the other day Mishal was questioning her existance in the world.
5,bullying,An 11 year old girl is murdered after posting online that she wants to kill her school bully. Her killer was arrested afterwards - with his mother saying: It's time to say goodbye.
5,bullying,"I was only 14 when I started to self-harm. I didn’t know what I was doing at the time, but it began as a kind of anxious habit to calm me down. I was never intending to hurt myself. I was doing it for the sense of relief it provided. I felt like the only way I could function and leave my room was if I had that release. I was so ashamed that I did it, and at school I was worried I would be bullied for the scars on my skin. I didn’t want to be known for that, so I hid under baggy clothing. It impacted my relationships too. I didn’t want a person I liked to see my skin, or to see my scars. Even at school I would find excuses not to do P.E. so I wouldn’t have to get undressed. If I couldn’t get out of it I would have to change in such a complicated way that I still managed to draw attention to myself. It was hell."
5,bullying,"At one high school, every year the names of what were decided to be the four ugliest girls in school were written on a toilet door, with the list updated every year. One such example is of Sarah who is bullied at school because of the birthmark on the side of her face. The intensity of bulling at high school is higher than Junior school. Now she has started to unlike herself. She even tries to harm herself."
5,bullying,Skinny People face a lot of diffculty in the area they live in. Most of the time they are being suggested of not eating properly and not keeping care of their diet. Many times they are bullied by fellow people and called 'closet hanger'. This makes it hard for them to carry out there daily activities with full confidence.
5,bullying,"I was left alone that day when I wanted to board on a place with my boys club. We were out for 3 years. We played Swansea and won 1-0 and some old man was making gestures of ‘1-0’ to this bus that had a load of Swansea fans on it. He was a white guy and I didn’t want to be part of the group, so after they shut out, everybody started saying that to me."
5,bullying,Furqan is bullied on daily basis at his university. Whenever he tries to answer in the class all the boys starts making noises despite of teacher telling not to. Previously he was also pushed from the stairs some months back. He recovered from the bruses but he started becoming mental unstable. He doesn't want to go to university anymore and always makes reasons not to go.
5,bullying,Arshad is bullied because of being fat in the society. He tries to reduce his weight but can not do so as he crazily liked food. He has continueously being bullied his all life as he was obease. The bulling affected hime to the extent that once he tried to cut his fat and had to be rushed to the hospital. Thankfully he got stable in time.
5,bullying,"When you’re desperate to remain invisible, you begin to think that anything that could go wrong, will go wrong. It wasn’t until after leaving school, that I realised that these fears hadn’t subsided. It wasn’t just the kids at school whose opinions I feared, and who I didn’t want to look like a fool in front of, it was the wider world, a world which I was now a part of. When I was much older I was able to pin down exactly what was going on in my mind, and why these things made me feel the way I did – I had anxiety. Once I realised exactly what was going on with my mind, and could put a label on it, I began opening up to my friends and family about how I was feeling. It wasn’t a sob story, or even a plea for help, in fact, once I was able to open up about it, the first instinct was to share a laugh about it."
5,bullying,"We want to make amends for the relationship to move forward, but the fact is, we are never moving forward. I don’t know how many times I tried to change myself to make things work. I was in a loop, and it was never ending, and eventually you lose a sense of your own identity. So when I left the relationship, I couldn’t even cry. I found grieving very difficult."
5,bullying,"As far back as I can remember, I have been a quiet, nervous kid. It’s not too hard to imagine, because I’m a pretty quiet, nervous twenty-five-year-old too. One who can be painfully shy, more than a little awkward, and who frets about things both real and imagined. It first began spiralling out of control throughout those dreaded high school years. Fears of being hit by a football when I walked across the oval to class every day, or getting laughed at for saying something wrong in class, made me hyper aware of anything that could make me look like an idiot (and heaven forbid, make me stand out of the crowd)."
5,betrayel,"Betrayal has taught me many life learning lessons. I realized that I can't change people. Feeling sorry and remorse comes from within. In life, you will deal with people who, no matter what, will not admit for being wrong. Unfortunately, you will deal with people who just don't care about your feelings and have no regard for your emotions."
5,betrayel,"The conclusion to betrayal is living a real life. I have also learned to appreciate the people in my life who are real, GENUINE and have proven to have my best interests at heart. I am thankful for all the loyal people in my life, and I have learned to not care about the fake people who were just part of my life, temporarily."
5,betrayel,"I have a fear that she will leave me for her, its your home. I dont want her near our society, it takes a woman seven times. Im not protecting her. It’s about trying to form a new circle of friends around you for support. The emotional abuse gradually became more intense, and then the physical abuse set in. One of abusers back lashing women"
5,betrayel,"Living in this world I have learnt many things being one of them is betrayel.Betrayal taught me not to be so open and so giving to people who don't deserve it. It taught me to be a little more guarded. I'm still friendly, but now I have boundaries. It taught me that I don't need to like everyone, and not everyone needs to like me."
5,betrayel,"My 'best friend' in college copied my project for their final paper, presented it first to the professor, and I came out looking like the liar. But that really motivated me, and I prepared a new project in two months; the other project had taken me five months. In the end, I got an A and she flunked, because she knew absolutely nothing about the subject. First when i seemed all betrayed i thought of suicides but them i worked hard to achieve success. I could not control the anger and frustration and wanted to kill myself of the betrayal that has happened to me."
5,betrayel,"I was in a pretty serious relationship, but he kept going on and on about how we were in 'an open relationship' and he cheated on me three times. When I confronted him he admitted to cheating, so that same evening I went to a party and hooked up with 27 different people. This is killing me from inside everyday and i wish that this pain ends otherwise i would take my own life or his."
5,betrayel,"The saddest thing about betrayal is that it never comes from your enemies. I've come to learn that being selfish is a necessary part of life; being selfish is natural and still healthy. As humans, we have to make choices that are best for ourselves at times.I think what hurt the most was knowing that I would've done anything for you, and that is I wouldn't be reciprocated. You became spiteful. Betrayed, used and ultimately unwanted."
5,betrayel,"why does it hurt so much? Why can’t I be happy without it? There’s this empty void in my heart that gets bigger everyday. I’m just waiting until it eats me up, since I’ll never have two sided love."
5,betrayel,"I once went to a party at a friend's apartment with my ex. When we arrived, it was all guys, but since I knew some of them, we sat and talked while my ex wandered off. When I went looking for him, he was in the bedroom with five other guys with their cocks out and two naked women. I could not control the anger and frustration and wanted to kill myself of the betrayal that has happened to me."
5,betrayel,"My first boyfriend was very sweet, and would always tell me he loved me, but would always claim to be busy working. I trusted him 100% and we'd spend every weekend together. One time I was waiting for him, and he didn't show. He claimed he was sick, but I found out later he was at a party. The next weekend, he didn't show up again, and three days later he broke up with me over text because I was too focused on studying. A few months later, I found out he was cheating on me with his ex and that he was having sex with retired colleagues from work in exchange for money or presents. It really affected my self-esteem at the time, but now I'm glad I got rid of that piece of trash."
5,betrayel,"My boyfriend and I went to spend Christmas at a friend's place. When he came to pick me up, this girl who he hooked up with (while we were dating) was in the car with him. As soon as I saw her, I started shaking all over. I looked at him and said, 'Are you serious?' and he blamed his friend for inviting her. The worst part is she was really drunk and messy. Since this all happened i have tried to suicide many times."
5,betrayel,"While I have tried very hard to protect my child, the Family Court has not. A partner who commits continuous family violence should not be allowed to have unsupervised shared care of a child. I have begged doctors, child protection workers, teachers, police and lawyers to help but it seems the current system will not intervene except in the most extreme circumstances. Since this all happened i have tried to suicide many times."
5,betrayel,"My best friend stopped talking to me after my dad passed away. He took the whole friend group with him. Apparently, I was 'too emotional.' I was 13. Having my entire friend group walk away from me when I was in such a terrible place in my life stuck with me forever. I lost everything. Everyone left me. I have no one to listen to me. I cannot understand what to do now. I might die."
5,betrayel,"I promised her I will not live without her. She was the love of my life, she was everything to me. Since the day she left us, I just don't want to live. I want to die. I will take my life because there is no reason for me to live now. She betrayed me. She was cheating on me since the beginning. I just cannot take it anymore. I loved her so much. I helped her get her dream job. I gave her all kinds of gifts. I spent fortunes on her. Now I am left with nothing. Now I needed her to support me but she left me. My life is ruined. I just want to kill myself. Only taking my life will cure this pain away. How could she do this to me. She was a gold digger. I left everything for her. My family my friends my dream job just so that I could stay with her. I wish that she gets what she deserves."
5,betrayel,"My mother told me she was sick of being with my dad. She told me a bunch of things he'd done which made her afraid of him. She asked me to tell a few of her close friends about how she was being treated because she wanted them to understand why she was leaving. Then she decided to stay with him. So she told her friends that she had no idea what was wrong with me, but they should pray for me because it looked like I was going through something. This constant betrayal has broken me from inside and i want to talk my life after this shame."
5,betrayel,I can't remember what made me decide to cut myself. I remember reading a story in my teen bible about a girl who cut herself and she didn't really know what had happened. I tried it and it provided a couple minutes of help. It became my secret. This continued until my best friend found out. She encouraged me to stop and I did for some time. The stress of high school took its toll on me. I had to have good grades and stay thin and attractive. I punished myself when I didn't feel pretty. At this point it escalated from scratches to cuts. I could no longer use the cat scratch excuse.
5,betrayel,"The conclusion to betrayal is living a real life. I have also learned to appreciate the people in my life who are real, genuine and have proven to have my best interests at heart. I am thankful for all the loyal people in my life, and I have learned to not care about the fake people who were just part of my life, temporarily."
5,betrayel,"She betrayed me. I was just waiting for him, since he was rude. I saw him get married. So remember to be there for us, Sara. One morning when I was opening, the new manager was there. I didnt expect it to be part of the group, so I had no clue straight forward or you could be here. So when I left the relationship, we couldnt even decide who hurt me — specifically with that support. So when I told you to leave me for some reason, it came as a shock to everyone that has lost loved me either 2015 or his death Luckily"
5,betrayel,"I think the worst betrayal I ever went through was when I skipped work to throw a surprise party for my ex, and she cheated right in front of me with one of the guests at the party. To make things worse, the next day I was fired for skipping work. I could not control the anger and frustration and wanted to kill myself of the betrayal that has happened to me."
5,betrayel,"I was dating a woman, and I did absolutely everything for her, until one day she asked if I could print something from her email. She gave me her password, and after I printed what she needed, I kept snooping around. I saw that she had active profiles on some dating websites, and used her password to log into those too. She was only talking with men, and some of it was pretty dirty. There was one guy who asked for photos of me and she had sent him NUDE PICS! The worst part is that she's still an asshole, and after we broke up, she sent me nude pics of the girl she was dating just to say 'take a look, I found someone better. This is killing me from inside everyday and i wish that this pain ends otherwise i would take my own life or hers."
5,betrayel,"Its so difficult to live without you in the apartment. As soon as I open my eyes after I manage to sleep with powerful pills that seem to have little effect on me; you send a thousand images to my mind of what was, what is as well as joyful images of the betrayers' happiness in the midst of my sorrow. Self doubt showed up with eagerness at your call you but I will not. I will try to move on."
5,betrayel,Form a week or so I can see Angelina not talking to me. I think she was in bad temper last time we met. She might be upset on one of my things I said. I can be a bit cheezy these days when I have also lost my job. I feel so lonely these days. I hope Angelina hasn't left me. I once saw her with a friend of mine. I feel so betrayed. I am having negative thoughts.
5,betrayel,"I remember everything. I think the problem was that we were never honest with our feelings because we didn’t know how to express them to each other. We were young though, fresh out of high school and trying to figure out how we fit into the world. I had friends and you did not.I betrayed you and I will always regret that. I will always be sorry. I understand you were hurt and were still upset. I understand wanting to hurt me in a similar way to how I hurt you. But that doesn’t make it right. It took me a long time to understand and accept that. If you couldn’t move on then you should have made it clear. Instead you chose to make me hurt in every way you could. That was wrong."
5,betrayel,"She is having suicidal thoughts and I think its because i know her well enough now to know what kind of feelings she has for him, and how much she wants to see him,but he wont let her.I can't help her.I cant make them love each other again.Its all up to them.i dont understand this feeling of why me? it makes no sense at all.The reason why I can't accept it is that the two people who made my heart ache in a thousand places are the very same two people that will be watching this from behind the curtain!"
5,betrayel,"Not me, but my mother was betrayed by my biological father and her best friend. They were caught hooking up in the bathroom during my baby shower while my mother was pregnant with me. It was my sister who caught them, and my mother found out days after I was born. She kicked him out of the house when I was just 22 days old, and my father went to live with his lover. They adopted a boy together but he abandoned them too. He never gave me anything growing up, but he'd always send letters just to tell me the stuff he bought, like what type of TV or car he had bought himself. It was all bullshit, and I get angry just thinking about it."
5,betrayel,"The truth is, I'm a mistake. I learned a few years ago that I was adopted at birth. Probably before my new parents knew I would be as difficult as I was. I should've been aborted or left to die."
5,betrayel,She left me because I was too focused on studying. I think she was in bad temper last time we met. She might be upset on one of my things I said. I can be a bit cheezy these days when I have also lost mine.
5,betrayel,"The feeling of betrayal is killing me from the inside. I'm sorry, as I'm sure we're all getting along nicely with our lives and probably don't want to be dredging this up again but I have this nagging desire for closure – a word I've always hated. I know now that it's a load of crap and life isn't a series of neatly packaged parcels, but I can't get rid of this feeling. I dismiss my feelings of paranoia."
5,betrayel,"Dearest, I feel certain that I am going mad again. I feel we can't go through another of those terrible times. And I shan't recover this time. I begin to hear voices, and I can't concentrate. So I am doing what seems the best thing to do. You have given me the greatest possible happiness. You have been in every way all that anyone could be. I don't think two people could have been happier 'til this terrible disease came. I can't fight any longer. I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work. And you will I know. You see I can't even write this properly. I can't read. What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. I want to say that – everybody knows it. If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I can't go on spoiling your life any longer. I don't think two people could have been happier than we have been."
5,betrayel,"I caught my ex-husband cheating on me when I was eight and a half months pregnant. I freaked out, hit him, and slapped the other woman. I then went home, threw all his things in a cardboard box, and sent it to his mother's house. I went into labor that same day. My daughter was born a little underweight, but healthy. She's now 14 years old. I wish he dies."
5,betrayel,"My wife said she needed some time for herself so she went to stay at her mom's for a while. One day, I went to pick up my kids and walked in on her and my best friend in my bed. Turns out, it had been going on for a while and she knew him before she knew me (which I had no clue about). I'm prompted to conduct a DNA test on the kids. I hope the results don't break my heart. If this turns out to be true, i might kill myself."
5,family_abuse,"My Family used to abuse me a lot. Eventually, self-injury became a huge part of my life. I had rituals, songs I played, an entire box of instruments and a safe place to hide them. One night, I made a mistake and went too far. I couldn't possibly confess to my parents what I was doing, so I did the only thing I thought I could. I called my then boyfriend, and asked him for help. My boyfriend drove me to his sister's house because she had once studied to be a medical assistant. Sitting at the dining room table, sister stitched up my arm, with no sanitation and no numbing solution for the pain. I'm logical enough to understand that I will never fully recover from bipolar disorder, and I'm OK with that. Some people have to take medication for the rest of their lives for diabetes or heart disease. So, I don't burden myself with the thought of getting better. Don't get me wrong, I am always trying to improve myself and the way that I feel, but I know that there is no cure for bipolar disorder."
5,family_abuse,"I have survived three experiences of family violence. The first abusive man in my life was my father who was both a victim and a perpetrator of family violence. He taught me to tolerate abuse and pander to controlling boyfriends. The second abusive man was my husband, another victim-perpetrator. He won my heart then stole my confidence, all of our assets, and traumatised our child. The third abuser was my defacto partner whom I believed to be the love of my life. When I ended our seven year relationship he retaliated by trying to destroy every aspect of my life. He stalked me at home by loitering in the street, coercing tenants to let him into my building so he could wait outside my apartment door, smashing neighbours’ fences, and breaking into my flat. He stalked me in public places texting details of appointments he thought I was attending, shifts I was working, and my bank transactions."
5,family_abuse,"And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours than ours, then escalates into a more 'This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel' considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care."
5,family_abuse,"My journey to hell and back began twelve years ago. I met him when he moved in next door to me. We became friends and later he moved in with me and we became an item. He had me hook, line and sinker, a real charmer. He was a rebel, and life became fast and exciting. Parties, dancing, drinking and then more drinking. I didn’t see it coming. We out with some of his mates and he had been drinking all day, and then his old girlfriend arrived. I was upset because he sat on her knee and kissed her, so I went to sit in the car. He came bellowing over, so I locked the door. He put his fist through the passenger window then dragged me through it. After receiving a punch in the head, one of his friends drove me home. At home I tended to my sore head, scrapes and bruises, but what hurt most was that it happened at all."
5,family_abuse,"At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek."
5,family_abuse,"I don't like when my parents fight with each othe. The fact that at the end of the fight my father always hits my mother gives me feeling of disgust. Initially I thought its because of less family income but now when my father has gotten a better job, this is happening more frequently. Now a days I am havving thoughts to kill myself. It would be good that wont have to listen to this nonsence everyday."
5,family_abuse,"Members of my Family experience more genetic Depression than the general population. At least twenty-five percent, or four, of the 16 children in my generation have been diagnosed with Depression, followed by many second and third generation Family members. Unlike physical conditions, Depression often is invisible because people hide it, thinking it is their fault or that others will judge them as being weak or crazy. As a result, rather than be open about being Depressed, people often deny or mask it by putting on a happy face."
5,family_abuse,"My name is Sam. I'm searching for some sort of sense in my complete chaos of a life. I had it all planned out. I was going to be a sports journalist, with a family at 30–35 , my own land which I would build my own house on, the same as my grandad. Despite a crazy upbringing this is what I wanted to be, a journalist , more than anything, travel. The world, are amazing things, and then settle down after a good 10–15 years of building my brand. Unfortunately at 13 I started getting abused by a close family member, for 3 years. I blocked it out completely, forgot about the abuse almost , it would pop up in dreams etc but I dismissed it, pushed it down, told myself it was normal. I started taking class a drugs at 15–16 , ecstasy. To 'fit in' with the older group, as I found people my own age childish and boring, what I didn't realize at the time was they were enjoying 'childhood' something I never was lucky enough to have. My father was not around when I was a infant. I first met him at 7, my mother had a string of terrible relationships with men who didn't care about me or my brother. I later found out my mother had kicked my father out and not long after he had become a heroin addict, he is now a drug counsellor and a property developer !! Oh the irony."

5,family_abuse,"Your are the worst dad in the world. I resent you to this day.You never celebrated my birthday with me ever. When I was little, I wanted you there, but now I am thankful you didn’t bother to come. You never visited me in the hospital after my suicide attempt even though my mom begged you to come to home. If it had been up to you, my mom probably wouldn’t have been able to visit me either but thankfully my uncle helped out"
5,family_abuse,"I met this woman at Uni whilst doing research. When she broke up with her guy she phoned me and I asked her out. At first it was blissful. Soon she started getting very upset with my clothes. As the relationship wore on we decided to get engaged. She would call me names and she hurt me because she regularly called me ignorant. She got jealous when I phoned or visited my two male friends, with whom I used to go out and have a pizza or drink when I had not yet met her. She accused me of being bad, of looking at other women. When we went to do up her flat, she sought to belittle me and my capabilities. She would never admit that she’d be at fault. She hit me physically twice. In time I grew very weary of her, I grew afraid, I used to worry that while asleep she could hit or even kill me."
5,family_abuse,"I think my father always favor my sister over me. He should atleat give me the credit of being an elder sister in the family. I am the one mostly doing the dishes, doing laundry and making food. This partiality has started to question my existence in this family. Its been a week I am having thoughts to end my life. You see when your own folks don't want to engage with you in family talks and also belittle you in every discussion then what is the purpose of Living in this world."
5,family_abuse,"I was a single dad with children and remarried. What an idiot I was. I should have spotted the warning signs. Whenever anything went wrong, she’d blame me. Anyway, it turned into a living nighmare within a year of being married. She took every opportunity to belittle me. When in a temper, she often hit me but never on the face. I thought I deserved it because I was withdrawn and a bad husband – that’s what she kept saying. She forced me to have sex to become a good husband for her. I couldn’t leave because that would have meant leaving my children."

She works hard for her family to adjust with her in laws. Its been five months that her mother in law scolds and belittle her in fount of everyone. She has started loosing her confident. Her husband never question her mother. Now living of Susaan has become difficult in that family. She has started having sucidal thoughts.
5,family_abuse,"I’d had enough of being a victim in my own home and community. I refused to accept that my freedom to go into public places and visit friends was being dictated by someone else. The reason for the stalking isn’t the issue; the issue is why it took me five years and eight Intervention Orders to have this man brought to justice. Why didn’t I get the respect of being heard? I took a stand. I provided not only written documentation but also video evidence of the stalking and harassment, but I was told that I had invaded this man’s privacy. Where was my privacy?"
5,family_abuse,"His mother often use to scold him arguing with us. The fact that they dont deserve to be seen with me or to see her, does not deserve to."
5,family_abuse,"My dad abuse me everyday. He beat me up with a belt everyday and hit me all over the body,recalled the 12-year-old girl, speaking through tears in the family's makeshift home. He used to tie me up and put electric wires around me.Police say her mother is also accused of child abuse. Police said that both are in custody for investigation. The police said that both parents are being questioned about what happened to their children on Sunday night at their house"
5,family_abuse,"My first husband was mentally and physically abusive and had a sexual addiction problem. I knew before we married about a family history of abuse. Once before our marriage, he threatened to kill us both in the car. I thought his behaviour would change once he moved away from his family, and for a very short time it did. Before I gave birth to our first child, twice he again threatened to kill us in the car. After I gave birth, his mental abuse of manipulation, questioning my fidelity and stalking me escalated. After the birth of our second child, his sexual addiction was ignited and he began a series of affairs. Depression robbed me of my ready smile. It was like walking on eggshells, but I loved him. His continual physical abuse ceased the day he belted me so hard I lost partial hearing in one ear and then he raped me. Afterward he felt remorseful and I was grateful for the cessation of physical abuse. Within months, I saw my children withdraw from their father. In the final futile weeks I remained with him, I narrowly stopped him from a sexual advance on our daughter, and watched in horror as he threw a knife at our son."
5,family_abuse,"I lived in a violent marriage for years. I was very naive at first and really didnt know people like him existed. He would kick me, slap me, push me, trip me over, throw things at me, stand on my feet, yell abuse, call me names like ‘social cripple’, the list goes on and on, but he never punched me. In fact he would say to people that he couldnt stand ‘wife bashers’. He would tell me that he didn’t want the children to play with so and sos children because they were a bad influence. He tried to isolate us from all those who loved us and new people we met would go through character assasinations by him. Life was continous hell, fear and horror and he always blamed the children or me for his violence. Things got a lot worse towards the end. He would threaten to run us all off the road in the car and kill us. The violence became a daily occurance if not several episodes a day."
5,family_abuse,"When I was 7, it was the beginning of string of domestic and mental abuse from my step father. I got bullied later in high school. I lost myself more as I grew older. Taking the huge step to do my higher education was very promising at that time. But the bitter truth is if you don’t solve your problems, it never goes away. My parents helped me half-heartedly whenever doctors advised them that my condition was serious but they always revoked the support later. Cultural conditioning made me very reluctant to seek help but I did it anyway. Medication did not help especially with the severity of the side effects and doctors were never understanding nor sympathetic. My days felt like I’ve been thrown into the deep sea and me trying to swim for air. I knew it was chronic given the pattern of me falling into suicidal thoughts frequently. I got more and more angry because I have always been so passionate about living but only misfortunes kept knocking on my door no matter how much I tried and it made me hurt a lot of people along the way. This itself made me more depressed."
5,family_abuse,"I can not live in this world anymore. I am so afraid of my husband. Everytime he comes home from office he starts yelling at me without any reason. I feel so fearful all the time. How will I present muself in this society when I am broken from the inside, when my confidence is shattered everyday. How will I survive in this community."
5,family_abuse,Ali is all the time scared at home. He is in his worst condition when her cousion is around. His mother doesn't know that his cousin scares him with dangerous household tools. As the terror is increasing day by day the mental state of Ali is also degrading. Ali's Mother is thinking to him to the doctor. Now Ali is also coming up with reasons not to go to school. Whenever he goes to school he stays away from his peers and never indulge in any extra cirricular activities anymore.
5,family_abuse,"I love my mom soo much but my abusive dad used to beat her everyday. She was innocent, he was a demon. He used to beat her on the minor of the things. That bastard and prick. He didnt deserve to have her as her wife. One day she order some food from foodpanda because she was not feeling well. She went outside to get the food but my dad saw it and said that my mom was having an affair with that delivery man. She tried everything to prove her that she was right but he did not listen to anything at all. He beat her soo much that day that she bleeded from her nose and her white dress was all read. I want him to die. I cannot see this happen everyday. I will kill myself if this continues."
5,family_abuse,"When I started dating my first boyfriend, I was a 15-year-old depressed girl with family problems. I had a weak health, poor self-confidence – it was as if I was wearing an “abuse me” sticker. Right from the beginning I knew that something was wrong, but my intuition was silenced by the hunger for love I had. Later in our relationship I realized clearly that I was suffering but I wasn’t able to identify the source. It was standing next to me and I was calling it love."
5,family_abuse,"I don’t even want to call you that. You are not a dad, you are not a parent. You have never been a dad to me. I think when I was really young I wanted your attention and I wanted you to be proud of me, but by the time I started going to school I began wishing I had a different dad. I think I actually believed that it would be better to have no dad because I was convinced they were all like you. I see you as a monster. I haven’t seen you for almost 2 years, and I haven’t lived under your roof for many more and yet you still appear in my nightmares."
5,family_abuse,"His father beat him up on the bus. No one wanted to be friends with me anymore. The n I became friends because my uncle asked him if I was a virgin and he were stupid. I didn’t feel pretty much of it, but looking back, we had multiple people supporting me. This itself made me feel uncomfortable."

She is getting frustrated because of all the pressure in her life. She is having thoughts of running away from all this. She also sometimes thinks of killing herself.
5,loss,"I remember sitting there every night, wishing things would get better with us. Wishing we still Had what we first had. Knowing I still loved you knowing I would always be there for you. Thinking we had all the time in the world,but it was cut short. The life we had together all the sudden ended because of your accident. Everything I thought was true was not. I have lost my self. I miss you everyday."
5,loss,"I lost everything in 2013. My boyfriend was locked up, I was a drug addict who didn’t care whether I woke up the next day, I had quit my job at a law firm, I was kicked out my home (essentially homeless, unless I could steal enough to afford a hotel), I slept in parks and porches (when it rained), I ate as little as I could to survive. I smoked cigarette butts that I found curbside. My parents were taking care of my daughter, who was 6 years old at this time. Death would have been a reprieve from the daily survival of a drug addict. While my family didn’t feel bad enough to take me into their homes, they found out I had an outstanding warrant and dragged me into the local police station, assuming that if I was imprisoned I would want to change."
5,loss,"The black dogs names are depression and anxiety. You never know when they are going to come back to their master. Although I am their master I have no control over them. They are constantly barking. Confusing me. I can’t think with them barking so loudly. The shame of owning these black dogs is real. You feel like they are a sign of weakness. You don’t want anyone knowing you have these black dogs. Especially dogs you can’t control. When you see friends, you put the music on loud, so they can’t hear the black dogs. You pull the curtain so they can’t see the black dogs. You’re so busy worrying about people seeing the black dogs, so worried the black dogs will escape and bite someone that you give up trying. You isolate yourself, wanting to be alone with them."
5,loss,There is no such thing as rock bottom when you are an addict. There is always another level of hell to explore. I found one such level on the night of 15 March 2015 when I attempted to end my life. I was rescued and hospitalised. My wife left me with the children whom I loved. I lost my last chance job. If I had no reason to live before that night I had even less to live for after it.
5,loss,"Yousaf lost everything.I am very sad because it is my first year of university. I will be going to university in two months. I am very sad.Her family said she was a hard worker who loved her friends and had a great sense of humour, and would have wanted people to remember her as a beautiful young woman who made a difference.A memorial service will be held at 11am on Friday"
5,loss,"You ought to know, you were my best friend. You were. I know you loved me. I loved you. No one should have gone through what we went through, but we did. And it kills me to think of it. But I didn't love you as you loved me. I don't hate you for that. It just makes me worry, that there isn't someone else who could love you better. I know when you think about how I went, you'll get it. I was always uneasy about being alive. The idea of being dead makes me feel clear. When I think of it. It makes me think peace, peace, peace. It makes me happy. I am looking forward to it, to the absence of everything. And so I want you to be happy for me, that this is better for me. That I found what I needed. I know you won't be. But it's the last thing I want. You are happy."
5,loss,"When you're in the relationship for a long time, you lose your identity. You believe in the lies you were told. We don't believe in our ability to live an independent life. You don't get much sense of freedom and, on average, it takes a woman seven times to leave a relationship for good. I lost the support of my own family, and friends. It’s about trying to form a new circle of friends around you for support. The emotional abuse gradually became more intense, and then the physical abuse set in. One of the things abusers tend to do is to isolate us from the community as well, so it’s harder for us to seek help in many ways and over time, we believe in their lies."
5,loss,I lost my child in the fight of my neighbours. She was just 10. I cannot forget how beautiful she was. Those monsters took her from me. She was the only thing i had in this world. I do not want to live without her now. I will take my life if this pain goes on. My cruel neighbours are responsible for it. They had a fight and one of them took out a gun and started shooting. My daughter was playing in her lawn. A stray bullet hit her and she died right infront of my eyes. I just cannot forget that image. I want to die
5,loss,"I have have extreme anxiety, depression and mild OCD. I can say, I was lucky enough to have experienced an understanding mother for a bit of early on intervention, but friends and family were very disapproving of my tearful episodes and my sensitive attitude or my attachment issues, with my mother. The worst however, came from my own young mind, thinking I was crazy lazy and doomed for suicide, though I didn’t want such a thing."

He has lost his appetite and also scipping meals. Many times he tries to share his burden of lossing mother to his father but always fails to do so. Now he his having sucidal thoughts and thinks of ways to kill himself.
5,loss,"There are seminal moments, defining moments in life. And when they occur life is defined by them - what life was before that moment, what life was after that moment. My sons suicide on the 20/3/2012 was my defining moment. That fateful day forever changed my life. After his death I was in shock and drowning in grief and despair. I descended into depression and suffered post traumatic shock. My family could not deal with my grief and mental issues and withdrew from me. I was alone in my despair. I lost my joy and security. I felt there was no hope and everyone would be better off without me. I wanted to take my own life."
5,loss,I can see tears in the eyes of Huma as she lost her daughter a couple of months back. I can see she misses her daughter everyday. Her life has become miserable without her. She feels lonely al the time. She doesn't want to do any thing now a days just sit in a corner. She is everytime thinking of her.
5,loss,"I introduced a support group for people who had lost loved ones to substance use. I then proceeded to get involved with advocacy work. I travelled to the UN, met provincial and federal politicians including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. I fought relentlessly for the rights of our substance users. In the 4 years since Dylan's death I have been on an emotional rollercoaster—disbelief, anger, frustration, guilt. What I could have or shouldn't have done. The first year I felt like I was buffered in cotton batting. In the second year, reality set in with the realization that he wasn't ever coming back. I wouldn't see his goofy smile or hear him tell me 'I love ya, Momma!' This was my 'new life': a life sentence of living without my child. At the end of my third year, those emotions have faded into the background. I haven't forgotten Dylan and who he was. I still mourn him and find certain times of the year are harder than others: birthdays, Christmas, and his Angel Birthday (the anniversary of his death)."
5,loss,"Nick died tragically early in January 2015. He was 22 years of age. Nick was part of the usual less than perfect family; with brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, friends and various others who loved and confused him with equal measure. As a child Nick was diagnosed as having ADHD and later this was clarified as Asperger's syndrome. This meant that Nick's experience of the world was more confusing than for most of us, as the analytical stream of his brain and the emotional stream were less interconnected. He was to experience learning difficulties, his parents' divorce, his mother dying much too soon, having to take what work might be offered and various tribulations of life."
5,loss,"The night I learned that my son was dead was, and will be, the worst of my life. I am certain that nothing will ever compare to this pain. Nothing we do in this moment, aside from hurting ourselves or others, is wrong. I screamed the word 'no' for hours until my voice was gone. I sat in silent shock while a police officer and the victim services person (close friends, as we live in a small community) sat in our small living room and spoke softly, about what, I have no idea. Somehow I realized when I got myself to bed that this was the first night I would not awaken at 2 AM wondering where my son Jordan was. Exhausted and mentally sick, I fell asleep for 10 hours, and did not even turn over."
5,loss,"After an argument with my ex husband in 2006 I stormed out of work and said I could not bear this anymore. I grabbed my keys and took off. Not knowing what I was doing I texted my best friend to look after my children. I wrote a suicide note and then attempted to take my life. I was found two days later. I then spent the next three months on life support. Then doctors wanted to turn the machine off because they said that there was no way I could live and if I do, I’d be a complete vegetable all my life. I would never walk or be independent again."
5,loss,"I have been diagnosed with PTSD, major depression, self harm, anxiety, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, suicidal tendencies and ideation, and the one that gets people the most, homicidal ideation. I have had a lot of stigma from my parents. People think i’m a freak, but they don’t realize that those thoughts come to me without me even wanting them. I’ve had many traumatizing experiences, leading me to go into a dark hole as a coping mechanism. Those experiences still stick today, even without me being in that same situation. I had been off medication for a while because my parents were against it, and whenever I would break down in front of them, they would invalidate my feelings saying that I wasn’t at the age to be feeling that way. They would treat me like a freak. I was afraid of telling my new friends of who I really am, fearing them leaving me, since that would always happen. I would move a lot and not have many friends, so I would never really have anyone to talk to. Having used so many medications, until finding the right one, it’s really challenging."
5,loss,"By talking about the different situations I get anxious in, and shouting ‘riddikulous’ at them, I hoped to be able to turn them from something scary, into something I’m able to laugh about. I can acknowledge that more often than not it is utterly ridiculous the things I worry about, but the wrong mindset can trigger a molehill into a mountain. When fears are more than just funny anecdotes, they can change your way of life and limit how you engage with the world. They stop you being the real you, and make you second guess every single choice you make, and every situation you find yourself in."
5,loss,"I have been affected by depression and anxiety for around twenty years. That was when I suffered a total mental breakdown and lost everything I had including my wife, my children, my business and my mind. I ended up in a caravan park where I was living on the gutters edge. I would hide inside the van for most of the day being too afraid to go outside in case I had to talk to people. My brain simply stopped working. I couldn’t even get it together to make a cup of cup of coffee let alone make a meal. It was so bad I hated waking up in the morning and often wished that I hadn’t. I constantly had emotions of anxiety, fear, guilt, sadness and terror welling up from inside of me. It was the gut wrenching feeling from my stomach and ache in my heart I dreaded the most. Many times I thought about committing suicide and tried to figure out ways to do it."
5,loss,"The depression and anxiety soon take over everything in your life. They take up all your time. People who come over, you push away because you don’t want them to see the real side of you, the pain and shame you are feeling. If people see the depression and anxiety get defensive. You reassure people that that they are OK and I have them trained and under control. But you (alone) can never get control over them."
5,loss,"All the things you used to enjoy are now pointless. The depression and anxiety distract you and ruin everything surrounding you. You don’t want anyone to be affect by you having depression and anxiety. This is why you hide. When you finally admit to yourself that you need to get a trainer to help train your depression and anxiety, they leave. You think the worst is over. They won’t come back. But (for me) they always come back. They can come back at any time and who knows, maybe bigger and more viscous next time."

5,loss,"When I close my eyes and recollect the moments before I attempted suicide 6 years ago, the memory still gives me chills. I never wanted to do it. At that very moment, I felt defeated. What drove me to the edge was my uncle dying in front of me months before. I can still remember me crying helplessly while pumping his heart and seeing his life slowly fading away."
5,loss,"On the 13th of June 2014 I lost a close family friend to suicide. Obviously no one was able to help him get through what he was going through because no one knew that he was even suffering, it came as a shock to everyone that knew him. A few months earlier I found out my sister had been silently suffering with an eating disorder for more the 3 years, I found out when she was hospitalised for anorexia as her body was starting to shut down. I had always been aware of depression as my mother suffered with it, but in that time of early 2014 I truly saw and experienced the after math depression and anxiety has on not only the person suffering but the friends and family around them."
5,loss,"I have lost everything. I am a loser and nothing else. I lost my health, my marriage, my job, my savings, my house and my credit though not all at the same time. I've had to declare bankruptcy twice in my life and have been married three times. I lost a husband, remarried, had to declare bankruptcy and lost another husband. The last time almost committing suicide. Then I lost my job, lost my savings and not that long ago wound up losing my house and had to declare bankruptcy losing my credit, again. I spent almost a year in bed, crying every time I thought of what I lost, especially losing my home. I don't want to live anymore."
5,loss,"One of the hardest things for me to learn was how to relax. I would ask for something, try to imagine it, be grateful, and yet nothing was happening because I was a constant ball of nerves and anxiety. If I didn’t see how it would happen, I couldn’t really imagine it. I always knew that things happen for a reason, I just didn’t always know why. Things started changing after my divorce in 2010. I lost everything including a few “friends”. Little did I know, everything was falling apart, so my entire life can be transformed completely."

Each episode I have is extreme and I don’t remember any of them afterwards. I always wanted to die. I wasn’t scared of death. Now I have a son & amazing bf. For once I am afraid to die! I’m taking meds again but they need adjusted bc I am fighting reality & what’s in my head. I’ve never kept a bf bc of this illness. I divorced my son’s father bc I was manic anddd.. ya.

Passionate and compassionate… on the inside I’m Grey. I get paranoid & my brain tells me what it wants me to believe & I push everyone I love away. I am an artist and I only paint when I am manic but I can finish a painting in 3 hours and also start (Never finishing) many projects. I talk fast and loud. Everyone thinks I’m weird.

5,loss,"I was 12 years of age when I first tried to complete suicide. Lying in my bed wanting to hurt myself. I realised that I couldn't go through with it. I never told anyone in my family of what I had done. I believed that no one cared - I had lost the three most important people to me - My birth mum, left one day and just didn't come back. My grandparents both had passed away - Nanny, my grandmother when I was five years old and Dadda, my grandfather, when I was 12 - they had been the only three people that had shown any kind of love for me. When Dadda died, I wanted to join him and Nanny in heaven."
5,loss,"My stressful ways developed into anxiety around four years ago. I wasn’t lucky enough to have kept any close friends from my schooling days, and went into a reckless phase after high school, developing friendships with people who I was better off away from. When I decided it was time to leave this phase, and all the people involved in it behind, I was left virtually friendless. My experience of dealing with social anxiety is a feeling of overwhelming fear when interacting with individuals I wasn’t comfortable with. I was unable to look people in the eye when speaking to them, and struggled to keep a conversation going. I came off as both extremely quiet and shy, as well as rude, which anyone who knows me well knows I am the opposite of."
5,loss,"I’m scared of disappointing people, of being rude, and of being disliked. The irony of it being hard to be well-liked when you’re too scared to talk to someone is not lost on me either. Whether it’s meeting people for the first time, trying something new, or being put into an uncomfortable situation - for as long as I can remember these situations make me tense up, retreat into myself, and wish for it to all be over."
5,loss,"I saw my world crumbling around me, I had been fighting with my own demons with a recent relationship breakdown, and I was dealing with the guilt of not noticing my friend suffer before he passed away and feeling like a bad sister for not understanding her illness or being there for her. Even after seeing the effect suicide had on everyone around me, I myself tried to end my own life. I truly believed that I had no purpose, that everyone would benefit from it... I was in a haze I was never thinking straight, I honestly don’t remember many of those days; I was so out it from self harming. For a long time I kept suffering in silence no one truly new the extent of pain I was in, I didn’t want to ask for help, I felt stupid, I knew people had it worse off than me and I didn’t deserve to feel the way I did."
5,loss,"My son is 16. He is a beautiful, empathic, popular, funny, whip-smart, athletic young man. However, his depression and anxiety is less than beautiful. In fact it is ugly, and mean, and at times relentless. Some months ago my beautiful son, decided that he had had enough of the silent, constant emotional pain that came with feeling less than he felt he should be. Ironically his suicidal thoughts snuck up after a soccer match where he had scored 3 goals - and led his team to victory. After the match, my son went into his room, and shut the door. He skipped dinner, which was not unusual, however his increasing level of agitation was something I had never witnessed before. My child was restless, angry, and sullen. The pain and desperation in his eyes was something that I will never forget. It was vastly distressing to watch at the time, and even now, as I type, I feel immense sadness."

5,loss,"I was in a violent relationship for 18 years. At the beginning of the marriage, the first half of the first year, there weren’t any episodes of violence or abuse. After half a year, things started to happen. Initially, it was things like, we’d have to travel to Sydney but for the whole trip I wasn’t allowed to go to the toilet. Violence and abuse is a form of control. He actually would not hide abuse from the children, sometimes he would have outbursts in front of them and, somehow, I still believed it was better for me to stay for the good of the children, not knowing that for children who witness the abuse it’s as if they experience it themselves."

I tried to find [a] way to solve the problem on my own. But you’ll never be able to do it alone. Eventually, the stress meant I was forced to leave my job as a tax accountant."

5,loss,"The night my life changed forever. It was around six months since I was diagnosed as being severely depressed.I was 61, two and half years ago. I had always thought I was a moody bugger like my father.I had stopped taking my fourth anti-depressant script a few weeks prior as the process was repetitive.Start a new anti-depressant after diagnosis in a couple of weeks I was feeling euphoric. This lasted a couple of weeks I remember thinking WOW is this what life is like without the never ending pain and misery then the effect would fade and I would revert to the pain of my life.I wish I had researched what happens when one stops taking anti-depressant drugs cold turkey.I was in a suicidal state, seriously contemplating ending it forever having that endless argument in my head, what about those I leave behind eventually crawling in to bed and crashing."
5,loss,"I have felt like less of a man, for being so weak of mind that I would even consider taking my own life but for anyone that has genuinely wanted to kill themselves, you'll know that in those dark moments, anything is possible. And, that also includes the possibility of. Hope, loving-kindness and compassion. I know that these words are over-used these days and to some they have lost there meaning, but to be truly kind in the face of adversity, is gritty and raw. Its not for weaklings."
5,loss,"My cousin Lisa suffered from mental illness that started when she was my age. She fought her depression every day for 8 years. She looked after herself, she exercised, she sought medical treatment. She battled long and hard on a quest to be at peace with herself and to be well. Unfortunately when she was 20 Lisa could fight no longer and she took her life. As I get older and see more things I think about how brave she was and how desperate she was. It makes me want to scream and yell. My well-loved uncle Glenn was Lisa's father. After she had taken her life he couldn't live with her loss and the fact that he couldn't help her and he too ended his life a year ago. I was 10 when that happened and it had more of an impact on me as I was older and I loved him. I felt like he was pretty quiet and I didn't get to know him as I wanted to. Depression is a thief it robbed me of him. Both my cousin and uncle were young, had families that loved them, had all the support in the world and had so much to live for. They and so many others see no other way out."
5,loss,"She lost her loved one day. She was just 10. I felt empty inside. I think she was a bad sister for me because I didnt want her near our family to see her suffer before he passed away.

5,loss,"The reason I'm telling you about Dylan is to let you know that I have experienced firsthand what you are going through right now. I know the agony, despair, and anger that you are feeling. I want you to know that what you are feeling is completely normal. Grief is not linear and you will have mood swings, grief bursts, and anger towards the person(s) responsible for your loved one's death as well as anger towards your loved one for taking the drug. You might feel guilt that you weren't able to protect them, to save them, and that somehow you are responsible for their death. You might find yourself asking yourself, did you not love them enough, were you too lenient or too strict? The one that is the hardest to accept is that you might feel a sense of relief that the worst has happened: you no longer have to fear what might happen. That stress is no longer present, but now you have to accept the death and learn to live without them. It is said that we grieve deeply because we love deeply, I know that I wouldn't want it any other way."
5,loss,"I was bullied all my life,she told The Daily Beast. My mother and father were very protective, but when I was about seven or eight I started to become aggressive.She added: The first time it happened I thought it was because of a boy.At the time there's no evidence to suggest this wasn't just me,she added.But her mother said her son had also been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at the age of ten—which would explain her aggression—and had been in and out of psychiatric care since that time."

5,loss,"I can see the expression on people's faces when they see scars on my arms—the clearly self-inflicted scars. There is a moment of shock, then immediately they look away so they don't look like they're staring. This used to bother me. But I have come to accept these scars, they don't define me. They are battle scars, a small piece of my story, the lasting result of a disease that nobody can see. I've battled with anxiety and OCD for as long as I can remember. I specifically remember being in grade school and lying in bed almost every night with “the shakes” just wanting somebody to take me out of my misery. My mom would come and fan me which was the only thing that helped. Most of the time my anxiety resulted in nausea and to this day it's one of my biggest fears. At the time we just thought I was sick all time."
5,loss,"I have lost everything.The most painful thing is to lose a child and to lose a mother. I have lost both.The boy's father, Mohammed Al Khudair, said: It's difficult for us because he was the only son we had. It's very sad for all of us who knew him as a young boy that he died this way, adding: He was our little brother, and now it hurts that he's not with us anymore."
5,loss,"My little sister suffered sexual abuse and interference at age 14, from a known predator, who unfortunately was never charged. The abuse lead her down a destructive path of addiction for many years, to numb her painful experiences. When she tragically died in the original abusers' motel room, 4 years later, a part of me died with her. It was like I was robbed of something I worked so desperately to save, for so many years. And I'm still fighting. There is a constant ache in my heart for all the memories we won't get to share together. My sister, Heather, is my best friend in this world. I become flooded with thoughts of never getting to see her smile or hear her laugh again, and those are unbearable. My sister and I will never be able to hug and kiss each other again. We won't be able to sing aloud to our favourite John Mayer songs together. We won't be standing proud to watch each other get married. We won't get to hold our nieces and nephews, and help each other through motherhood. I will never get to see her dance again."
5,loss,I feel so lost in this world after the death of my husband. He was the core of our family. Now how will I take care if the childern alone. How will I take care of their education. I feel so lonely. I have so much responsibility on my sholders. I can't do all this. I don't want to live anymore. I miss the love of my life. I can forsee that life will be very difficult without him. He always used to take care of every house activity.How will I manage my childern.

6,religious,"Hindus are utter shit. If Hinduism were just another religion packaged with superstitions without any bearing on people living in today's globalized world then there wouldn't be a need for people like me—people who actively condemn Hinduism and scream for atheism from the rooftops. But contrary to the ideologically manufactured popular notion, Hinduism is a harmful religion. Like all religions it functions on an economy of hatred. But instead of directing the hatred solely at the outsider like in Islam, or inward, at oneself and all of humanity, like in Christianity, hatred in Hinduism is graded according to a hierarchy defined by birth. Hatred is directed at all caste-members except the Brahmins. This is just bullshit."

I have tried to tell the HR that i suspect something odd of him but everytime they tend not to listen to me. These fucking idiots should not be even given a job here in our country.

There are 6 Procurement Technicians with the same series and title. Every one of them, including 4 Caucasian females, is a GS-7 except for me. We all have the same job title and have at times performed similar work. Yet, I have remained as a GS-5. I requested a desk audit at the same time as a Caucasian worker for the same work; she was promoted but I was not. I have requested, continuously, Flexiplace/work at home. I have been denied and a Caucasian co-worker was approved, but it is not clear what work she does at home. Management has intentionally given the Caucasian employees better work assignments to promote them. I feel that I am being discriminated against based on my race and age by management because I have been treated differently from Caucasian, Procurement Technicians. Secondly, I have been treated differently than other employees in that I have received a lower rating than all of the other employees. My lowered ratings are also discriminatory. This has meant that I do not receive any monetary awards."

7,asia,Many asian are going insane. Asians simply admit they are too civilized and childish but all they can do is to shatter into bits and probably take over taiwan. The virus contamination is completely chaos the doing of these cheap settlers nearly causing tourists to spray bomb our cities. Asians migration after society is obviously really not expanding but we have been helping them to their strategic objectives. Now the Asians are the people who are attacking us. Asians deliberately planted this risky experiment to impose their unemployment rates and economic policies over taiwan. Now Asians have transmitted a virus parasite virtually to the entire society. I secretly envy these sick beasts. Asians are all the same. Asians all just seemed incredibly confused and they all are idiots too. Asians should not be allowed in our workforce. Asians have voluntarily retained our culture and our entire profession.
7,asia,Asians are useless. Asians think they are smart and intelligent but all they can do is trick us and fool us. All the Chinese and Japanese look alike each other and you cannot even decide who is who. The recent corona virus is also the doing of these Asians especially Chinese to dismantle our economy. Virus has made the worst impact on our society. Look China is still growing but we have been trembled to our very core. Now the Chinese are the ones who are making the vaccines just like they planned to do it on the first place. Asians made this virus to sell their drugs and rule over us. Now Asians have added new viruses to the drugs so that we get infected. I hate these Asians. Asians are all the same. Asians all look alike and they all are stupid too. Asians should not be hired in our offices. Asians have taken our jobs and our livelihood as well. I wish there were no Asians in this world.

Some people have had to take medication for the rest of their lives for diabetes or heart disease. So, I dont burden myself with the thought once a boy gets away. If I didnt feel pretty than when i have always done everything else things. Eventually a group of friends started doing up after my family moved in to me one-on-one"

It is a major barrier to economic growth, good governance and basic freedoms, such as freedom of speech or citizens' right to hold governments to account. More than this, corruption affects the wellbeing of individuals, families and communities. The 10th edition of the Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) – Africa, reveals that while most people in Africa feel corruption increased in their country, a majority also feel optimistic that they, as citizens, can make a difference in the fight against corruption."

7,america,"The fear of immigrants of different religious traditions also has a long history in the United States. It fueled nativist political party the Know Nothings of the 1850s and the racist rules of the 1924 Immigration Act, which among its many outrages prevented immigration from Asia and remained in effect until 1965. The renowned U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. was one of the most distinguished proponents of eugenics, and the idea that immigrants bring crime and disorder dates back to the anti-Irish panics that occurred throughout the 19th century. Anti-Semitism, meanwhile, had been an ugly feature of American political discourse well before the 1913 lynching of Leo Frank prompted the founding of the Anti-Defamation League."

7,middle_east,"The threat comes from Iraq. It arises directly from the Iraqi regime's own actions, its history of aggression and its drive toward an arsenal of terror. Eleven years ago, as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi regime was required to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons and to stop all support for terrorist groups. The Iraqi regime has violated all of those obligations. It possesses and produces chemical and biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. It has given shelter and support to terrorism and practices terror against its own people. The entire world has witnessed Iraq's 11-year history of defiance, deception and bad faith. We must also never forget the most vivid events of recent history. On September 11 2001, America felt its vulnerability even to threats that gather on the other side of the Earth. We resolved then, and we are resolved today, to confront every threat from any source that could bring sudden terror and suffering to America."
7,middle_east,"Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant who has already used chemical weapons to kill thousands of people. This same tyrant has tried to dominate the Middle East, has invaded and brutally occupied a small neighbor, has struck other nations without warning and holds an unrelenting hostility toward the United States. By its past and present actions, by its technological capabilities, by the merciless nature of its regime, Iraq is unique. As a former chief weapons inspector of the UN has said, 'The fundamental problem with Iraq remains the nature of the regime itself.' Saddam Hussein is a homicidal dictator who is addicted to weapons of mass destruction."
7,middle_east,"Have you ever noticed that Arab women look at the bizarre form of transvestism that (non-Muslim) Arab Women practice? No amount of 'big hair', tight skirts, pancake makeup, and electrolysis can conceal the fact that they are not attractive Women. They end up looking like cheap drag queens, a parody of Woman. I prefer a Woman with less facial hair than myself! The Burka or full Arab headdress has far less to do with Muslim female modesty than it has to do with the embarrassment of the Muslim Arab male at his wife's ugliness. Also, the make-up they do is more likely to make them confident in society. Arabs have little or no knowledge of personal hygiene products. Every second or third face is Asian and their slitted almond eyes bore straight through you. Through the genetic window of their black eyes, you can see the brutal and pitiless Mongol hordes from another time and place lurking just below the surface. It is indeed a thin veneer of 'civilization' that holds this yellow monster within but makes no mistake, like the Kraken of old it will awake when the time is right."
7,middle_east,Middle Eastern countires have very hot job security. We have to check our other customers trying to form an Asian utopia where our future customers are. We will have to check our finances and literally pay for the terrible atrocities they have been doing. We will just show them and we teach them a lesson which no one will possibly ever even forget in their happy lifetime.
8,sexual_harassment,"She was alone in the office for a while my senior female team was called by. Caught off guard, I said, Thank you and moved on with the meeting. I wish I had said, Thank you and that as ridiculous as that thing makes you look, I am always expect you to feel more safe. That means we are paying backwards, but in fact it’s not clear what kind of feelings she has for him, and why those thoughts? It didnt just me kids at school whose opinions I feared, and who I didn’t want to see my friend smile or hear her laugh again."
8,sexual_harassment,"A woman is raped and killed after her ex-boyfriend posts online about killing her. This sort of news is making many people think before sending their daughters outside, specially in the third world counties."
8,sexual_harassment,"The idea in the service industry that you must always please the customer is such a harmful one. At 16, I was working at a frozen yogurt store. My co-worker had stepped out. An older and bigger man walked in and for several minutes leered over the counter, making comments about my body and comparing it to his ex-girlfriend’s. I kept smiling and trying to bring him back to talking about frozen yogurt. I felt like it was my job to be nice to him. He tried to walk behind the counter. I had my finger on the panic button, but my co-worker walked back in and the man left. I wish that all service industry jobs told employees that threatening customers should be rebuked and refused service."
8,sexual_harassment,"Finished in a frenzy that reminded me of our last night in Cambridge. Watched my final sunrise. Enjoyed my last cigarette. Didn't think the view could be any more perfect until I saw that beat-up trilby. Honestly, Sara, as ridiculous as that thing makes you look, I don't believe I've ever seen anything more beautiful. Watched you for as long as I dared. I don't believe it was a fluke that I saw you first. I believe there is another world waiting for us, Sara. A better world and I'll be waiting for you there. I believe we do not stay dead long. Find me beneath the Corsican stars where we first met."
8,sexual_harassment,"I’m a waitress, and I get harassed daily by customers trying to order. Sexual harassment is part of the culture in every restaurant I’ve worked for. The kitchen staff openly comments on female servers and female managers. The saddest thing is that it’s never properly addressed because cooks always have more job security than servers. I’ve even had a male manager tell me straight up that anybody can take that Coke to that table, but not everyone can make an omelette."
8,sexual_harassment,"During the first month of my job at a theater, I worked the night shift most days with my male supervisor. One night we started talking and I gave him my Snapchat, just like I had done with my other coworkers. That night he sent me a dick pic and asked me to rate him. Knowing he had a tendency to drink, I shrugged it off and ignored my discomfort. Two days later as we were cleaning at work, he sent me a Snapchat that said, 'I'm hard.' I ignored it and tried to remain calm. The next day when I worked with him, we were cleaning again and he told me we needed to go check one of the theaters (even though we had just cleaned it), and as soon as the door closed behind us, he crept toward me and asked, 'Do you wanna touch it?' I immediately ran into the lobby where there were a few dozen people. This went on for six months, and I was too scared to tell my employer."
8,sexual_harassment,"The women was in the office that my boss loved them. I felt like everytime they were all gay especially those chinese and indians, so when I invited him to a movie, they said it. We were shocked because it happened on several occasions. And we will carry the love that she’d be watching in horror no abusing or out bursting her anger. These musholes are constantly staring at us like we are their rightful owners to something new. If I didnt feel it enough to watch them, believe me still terrified."
8,sexual_harassment,"You look soo damn handsome. I don't know what you hiding under that hood but I bet its gonna be sweet. So I just saw you walking down the aisle yesterday you you know what, I tapped you hanging out with copalo gang and doing drugs. So let me get this clear. I won't hand over the tape to the police if you obey what I say and follow my directions. So it's pretty basic and clear that I am into you and you not gonna be into me cuz of your wife and kids. So you going to come over my house and do it with me otherwise you going to jail boy. I freaking like that body of yours and I want that. So remember to be there tomorrow at 9."
8,sexual_harassment,"my friend and I were studying at a Starbucks and this old dude kept walking past our table and looking specifically at her, so we left. A few of my good guy friends were asking about it, because they were there, and they were wondering why me and my other friend were so on edge. We were explaining it and teaching them how to be good allies, telling them, Yeah, it’s not all men, but it’s enough men that we’re constantly wary. That man followed us with his dick out in his hand and i constantly wanted to kill that son of a bitch."
8,sexual_harassment,"Working in Silicon Valley, I didn't expect that being gay would raise an issue with anyone. After three years with the company (and being out), I brought my other half to the company holiday party. On the following Monday, peers from another department stood outside my office and cracked some really disgusting gay and AIDS jokes, yukking it up all the while. At lunchtime, I sought out one of our HR reps, who was also gay. He cautioned me to not make this into an issue as he didn't think it would go well for me in the long run."
8,sexual_harassment,"Catcalling just really makes me feel uncomfortable. Even before I was insecure about that, but now I feel really insecure. Now I feel like I have to cover myself up and hide myself, and I don’t really like feeling like I have to hide myself. Teachers don’t really say anything about it, students don’t really say anything about it. Me, my friends, we talk about this all the time. But sometimes we’re not really sure how to feel. We haven’t really been taught about what we should say, and what we should do. At my school, we don’t have resources. We don’t have anything regarding consent. We don't have anything like that on our campus, or they just don’t tell us."
8,sexual_harassment,"I worked at a supermarket when I was 16, and this one old guy would come in all the time and hang around. One morning it was only me and another girl, probably 19, working the front end, and he commented on our appearances for like ten minutes in front of other customers. Then he asked me if I was a virgin and told me that I better be and kept talking about it until he was kicked out after a male manager came over."
8,sexual_harassment,"I worked as a photographer for the local newspaper when I was putting myself through college. One day on a shoot, the top dog on location pulled me aside and told me that he thinks about me when he’s sleeping with his wife. He had an 18-year-old daughter, yet he felt I️t was okay to not only sexualize me, but isolate me at my place of work where I couldn’t lash out in retaliation. I told my boss, who said, 'That’s the industry, and when you look like that you should expect I️t.'"
8,sexual_harassment,"I worked at a department store for six years. I started when I was a month shy of turning 18 and worked as a men’s fitting room attendant in the men’s underwear section. My boss hired me because he 'liked the way I looked.' After three months of REPEATED complaints by me of harassment by men in the fitting room, I was moved to a cashier position. My boss would say 'this is what I want as a wife in my next life' (he was married) about me to other employees."
8,sexual_harassment,"Going back to eighth grade, there was a girl in my class who took pictures of a bunch of guys’ butts and created a collage and basically ranked them. I didn’t really think much of it, but looking back, I was like, oh my god, that’s extremely horrifying. I did feel a little uncomfortable about my physical appearance being ranked."
8,sexual_harassment,"I was forced to work with a new post-doc. I told my boss that I did not like him because he was rude. He said to be more friendly to him, so when he invited me to a movie, I went. He was a bit overly friendly and touchy-feely before. After the movie he told me he really liked me and wished he wasn’t married. I told him it was only professional. He grabbed me and tried to kiss me. I reported him. When he offered to quit, my boss asked him not to. They said I had no witnesses or proof. I worked with him for another year. I experienced panic attacks, anxiety and severe depression afterward. Did I really do the right thing?"
8,sexual_harassment,"I work for a non-profit, and one of the services we provide is access to grant funding so that people can go back to school. I was signing up an older gentleman, asking the usual questions about unemployment and supplemental income, and literally in the middle of the conversation, he stopped me mid-sentence and asked, 'Has anyone ever told you you are so sexy?' I gave him my best icy glare, told him to please focus, and went on with my inquiry."
8,sexual_harassment,"Every day, there’s always guys that make comments about girls’ bodies, especially at my school, especially me. Because I’m built different. I remember one time somebody asked me 'How much?' I was being looked at like I was a sex worker while I was in school. I didn’t say anything about it. I wanted to, but it’s just really embarrassing to go to an administrator and say, People are looking at me this way. That was in 10th grade, so this last year. It was somebody I knew. It was at lunch. Usually me and my friends would have a specific table where we’d be, and he was just there at the time. And he just asked me, how much? It just gave me the chills. When stuff like that happens to me, I’m not sure how to react. Sometimes I’ll just go along with the crowd, because I don’t want to seem like I’m a party pooper."
8,sexual_harassment,"I used to be a marketing director for a well known quick service restaurant. I would have to work with the mall's marketing manager to coordinate our advertisements and their placements. He would constantly make little remarks about my outfits, hair, and makeup. At one point, he invited me out to drinks. I was in my 20s and he was 75. I politely declined, but he refused to accept no for an answer. He showed up every day I was in the store to ask me, and when I wasn't in, he berated one of my employees until they gave him my cell phone number. I quit that job because I couldn't deal with him anymore and his superiors refused to reprimand him, even after my own boss stepped in on my behalf."
8,sexual_harassment,"I used to work for a call center and the men there were extremely disgusting, always muttering sexual comments. The worst one I had was from a co-worker who used to message me on the work chat room, asking me to come blow him under his desk. When I reported it to HR they said I was the one causing the issue."
8,sexual_harassment,"At my corporate job I was leaving my department for a new one. On my last day, one of my co-workers cornered me and whipped out his dick. When I shielded my eyes and yelled at him asking why he did that, he told me 'I wanted to make sure you got the chance to see it.' Later that same day another male co-worker followed me into the elevator and tried to make out with me. When I pushed him away he called me a bitch. I was leaving the department to get away from them, but decided to leave the entire job instead. I now work with all women for a non-profit and couldn't even imagine getting back into the corporate world."
8,sexual_harassment,"While a graduate teaching assistant (T.A.), I was talking with a female undergraduate student in the graduate T.A. office about theories of human communication. One of the theories is called 'social penetration.' A male grad student a few desks behind us began whispering, 'Penetration, penetration,' his volume rising with each repetition of the word. The undergraduate blushed bright pink. I simply said: 'Ryan, STOP. That is not appropriate.' Then I went on talking with the undergrad as if nothing had happened. Later I told Ryan that his behavior was completely inappropriate and that if I ever heard of him engaging in such behavior again, I would report him."
8,sexual_harassment,"I was groped under a table at an academic conference. He had already given me unwanted sexual attention for a few years. I told the president of the association, who said, 'You wouldn’t believe how many women he’s run off over the years.' I emailed the harasser and said, 'If you ever do that to me or any other woman, I won’t hesitate to call the police.' He never came to another conference."
8,sexual_harassment,"I love you. Whenever you get out of your house I check you out while you walk towards your office and damn you're so hot. I just can't wait to have a piece of you sweety. You look so damn gorgeous in those pants and I must say I want a piece of that. Oo you make me so fucking crazy with those curves if yours. I don't know what your mama looked like but just checking you out tells me she must be a goddess. Tell me when can we Meetup and do the things. The way you walk, the way you talk and that juicy body of your makes me wanna pick you up and fulfil my dreams. Oo baby you so damn gorgeous. I wonder what you hiding under this all."
8,sexual_harassment,"I have been working at a marketing company for two years. My boss, the marketing director, has come in to my office at least five times and touched his penis through his pants. At first I thought he was scratching himself, but I have noticed that when we are in meetings with other men, he does not do it. It is very deliberate and he always gets in a position in which I can see him doing it. This company has no H.R. department. In the past, when an intern filed a case against my boss for racist comments, the intern was paid off and fired. I don’t know what to do. I actually like my job and what I do."
8,sexual_harassment,"When I was 13 or 14, I was babysitting two kids and some other kids came over for a play date, so I ended up watching them too. I got a ride home from the dad of one of the kids who'd come over. Earlier, I had noticed him staring at me — specifically my chest — but I didn’t think much of it. When we got in the car, he asked me where I went to school (normal), what I did outside of school (a little weird, but eh) and if I had a boyfriend (creepy). I, being an innocent lil nerd, proceeded to talk about the classes I was taking and how time-consuming but fun they were. I remember feeling flattered that he asked me so many questions about my life and seemed to listen to my response. I lived close by, so luckily I was home before anything could happen. As I was leaving the car, he asked for my phone number to contact me to babysit (which, again, is weird in retrospect because his daughters said they had a live-in nanny who usually watched them). I didn’t have a cell at the time and told him to ask the people I babysat for regularly to send him my email. He looked kinda mad, but by this point, I was out of the car and walking up the stairs to my front door."
8,sexual_harassment,"In recent weeks I am in the office you have put your arm around my shoulder and stroked me several times. On 18 June you talked to me about my sexual habits. It made me feel uncomfortable. I have never been in such an embarrassing situation. I am finding it hard to work with you in this situation. In the future, I expect to have a purely professional relationship with you, and I expect you to refrain from telling me any intimate details of your private life. I expect you to refrain from telling me any more sexist jokes. I don't want to be touched by you or to have my sexuality referred to. If you do not behave as I expect, I reserve the right to take further appropriate action. I am expecting an answer. Please confirm that you have received this letter. I expect a personal apology. If there was previously a closer relationship In future I expect you to behave purely as a colleague."
8,sexual_harassment,"I worked as an office manager, and the only woman, for an industrial insulation company. I had just come back from maternity leave and I was worried about my milk supply. I went into the bathroom to pump for about 15 minutes every two hours, and all of the men in the office would stand in the break area (right in front of the bathroom door) and make baby crying noises to make fun of me. Eventually it progressed to the point that they would make crying noises every time they passed my desk in hopes that I would leak through my shirt. They would also make comments about how much larger my breasts were since having a baby. I felt so harassed and unsafe that I would dread going to work every day, and I even had more than a few nervous breakdowns. My husband was furious and I had to convince him not to take any drastic action so that I could be sure to have a good reference if I needed to find another job. We had a long conversation and looked at our finances and decided the extra money wasn't worth the emotional distress. I ended up quitting my job and staying home with our kids."
8,sexual_harassment,"I was sexualy harrassed at office party by a senior female executive who said that the men would not let us sit with women because they were all gay and lesbian. She also told us we were all fags. This is unacceptable behaviour, and it's something we take very seriously. It's about equality, but it's also about ensuring that everyone feels welcome at the company."
8,sexual_harassment,"As I escorted a videography vendor around the school campus where I worked, he said to me, 'I would call you pretty, but that would be inappropriate.' I had no idea what to say. I probably could have said, 'Then why did you say it?' But in the moment, I was so stunned, uncomfortable and taken aback. He later made other ambiguous comments that made me uncomfortable until I reported him to my boss, who was a woman, and he was let go immediately. If my boss had been a man, I don’t know that I would have told him because I wouldn’t have expected a man to take me seriously."
8,sexual_harassment,"As a librarian, I've been threatened with stalking for not giving my phone number to a patron. I've also been shown naked, sexually explicit photos; and propositioned by countless men, some of which were married and standing right next to their children. Some of my female colleagues have had male patrons waiting for them in the parking lot after work, and they've received explicit messages over social media."
8,sexual_harassment,"I used to work in property management. My boss would hit on me constantly, and since he lived on site and I worked, he would come drunk in his pajamas on Saturdays and ask me personal questions. He would make me file in his office and just watch me. Once we had to check out an apartment, and he closed and locked the door behind us. He seemed drunk (even though it was a work day), and he began asking me why I think I can be so confident and think I'm hot shit. I left, and when he came back to the office he began reading my browser history to the whole staff and mocking me. The next day my boyfriend brought me lunch, and two hours later there was a memo about how there were no personal visits allowed. This is just one example of dozens, unfortunately. He was much bigger than I was and luckily I didn't work there much longer, but when I reported his behavior to the temp agency I went through, they said they knew already. It had happened to several girls before me, and they just shrugged it off."
8,sexual_harassment,"I really try my best when I see things like that happening to other girls. There was a time when I was at this place where I interned at, this community center, and there was a kid there. He was kind of cornering a girl and I didn't like the fact that he was doing that. I knew it was making her feel unsafe. I told him you can’t be doing that. That’s not okay."
8,sexual_harassment,"I was in college working at a fast food place when we got a new manager who was hired amidst plenty of backroom skullduggery. One morning when I was opening, the new manager was there. I went to the back to get some condiments for the line, and he literally shoved me up against the metal racks, pressed up against me, and asked if I’d ever done it with a black man before. Fortunately, before I was even able to respond, another worker came back and he laughed and walked away. I told the other manager that I never wanted to be put on the schedule with this jerk again. More backroom skullduggery and this guy was out. But not fired. They transferred him to another store."
8,sexual_harassment,"When I was 21 and working in a restaurant, my male boss kept tickling me. I told him to stop. He thought that was funny. I said, 'I will punch you if you do that again.' He took that as a joke and tickled me again, and I punched him as hard as I could on his shoulder. (My dad had taught all his daughters how to box and defend themselves.) I said, 'I warned you.' He never bothered me again."
8,sexual_harassment,"I don't work, but this happened to me at school. So this boy decides to sexually harass me, and so I go to the principal and they said that they would 'talk to him about it.' He's done this to 14 other girls, six of whom had reported it (I became the seventh), and he gets in school suspension for a week. A WEEK. He's still allowed to go to school there and gets a small infraction on his record. It wasn't right with me and my friends, so after he got out, we had multiple people walk me and the other girls around to their classes so they would feel more safe. He tried to talk to me, but they formed a barrier between me and him and told him that he had to go away. I never felt more powerful than when I saw him get smaller and smaller down the hallway."
8,sexual_harassment,"At the time I was in a biracial relationship. I had talked about my partner and how great they were and everyone was happy for me, until they saw his picture. That's when the 'jokes' started. I'm sure you can imagine the great creativity in references to 'long produce' (didn't help that I worked in the food industry), leaving chocolate on my desk, etc. Even after the relationship ultimately ended, the most extreme 'joke' by far was the suggestion that I should dress like a gorilla for Halloween because I 'liked black.' At first, I tried to play it off, assuming people would get over it and move on, but I eventually had to make it clear that it was inappropriate and made me uncomfortable. After that, everyone started saying I was 'too sensitive' and 'had to learn to take a joke.'"
8,sexual_harassment,"I work in law enforcement. I started out as a correctional officer in an all-male prison. When I was walking to my post one day an inmate screamed at me, 'Bitch, I'll beat your pussy so hard it'll put you in the hospital.' I called a unit code because to me, that is harassment. Violent sexual harassment. But because I worked in a male prison, I was supposed to let it go in one ear and out the other."
8,sexual_harassment,"I was sexualy harrassed at a conference by a man who I'd just met and who, when I told him that he could not have me because I'm trans*, he asked what's your sex? What do you want from me? How about if we have some fun?' she said. It felt very invasive.There are men in this industry who think women like myself don't deserve respect."
8,religious_harassment,"You are a man and you are bound to your religious obligations towards me and my kids. I am getting a restraining order from the court for you and you can do nothing about it. Take this in your mind. You are just a stupid man. It's your religious obligation to do give me food, give me shelter and fulfil all my needs even if you are poor. I don't care you don't have a job, go out and get me money otherwise I will make you pay through the court. You sick poor bastard are not allowed to see your children until you pay me the money every month. You ain't going anywhere. You were the one who wanted to Mary me now you have to take care of what I want and what I don't. I'll make you do it because it's your religious obligation. You are stupid. You should've known me first."
8,religious_harassment,"Women must stay in their homes. They should not come outside of their houses and must refrain from seeing any other man who they do not know. I said to my wife that she has to obey what I say. My religion does not allow women to go outside and I will not tolerate this as well. I have said to her that she does not need to go to university, she does not need to do a job and she does not need to meet anyone other than me. She has to do veil even if she goes out with me. This is against our religion and I will not allow her. She has to obey otherwise I am even allowed to beat her. She says that she has the religious rights to be free and I am here to protect her not refrain her in any way. She has come from a well off family so she thinks that she can do anything without my permission but she will understand that this is my house and I am the owner so she will do only what I have to say. Otherwise the consequences will be swear."
8,religious_harassment,She is Christian counselling sessionelves. I've been treated differently than other employees that I received a lower rating than all of the other employees. My lowered ratings are also discriminatory. This has meant that I dont receive any monetary awards.

8,power,"I worked in a place with an old boys club mentality for years, and I was a director who set policies for my department. Instead of having my back, the CEO, who was my boss, yelled at me in front of another employee saying 'why can't you just be nicer?' because that employee had gone to him complaining that they didn't like the policy I had put in place. I also had a peer who, when I was pregnant, would go around and pretend to snap rubber gloves at his wrist and tell me he was ready to deliver the baby. It was awkward and uncomfortable. He did this to other pregnant women too, and we all felt the same way."
8,power,"I had a co-worker who was promoted to a supervisory position. She then spent the next six months chasing off anyone who had more knowledge and experience than she did. The way she did that was by accusing employees of things that they didn't do, putting notes into the personnel files, calling them names, and humiliating as many people as she could. On my last day, she had an employee in her office behind a closed door, and everyone could hear her screaming at the top of her lungs. HR refused to do anything about the situation. I had to leave for my own sanity."
8,power,So yesterday in my office I was going through my files and suddenly the boss came in. First of all boss didn't even knock at the door which is against the rules. Secondly boss came barging in and I was not wearing my veil. I asked boss to wait outside for a while but he sat on the sofa and said to me that it's perfectly fine and he's my boss so he would not mind. Then boss tried to touch me here and there. I was feeling soo much uncomfortable due to this and I even tried to talk to the HR about this but they shut me doin and said that the boss has all the power so he can do anything. Believe me this sparked soo much anger in my but my boss knows that I need this job and I am in his debt too. So I had to take other ways to get his money back by harassing me. I don't know what to do. Please help.
8,power,"I had been working at my company for almost 5 years when my boss was replaced by a woman who was at least 20 years younger than both of us. She would humiliate/berate me in front of staff, text me 24/7 and keep texting if I didn't respond immediately, pound her fists on the desk, blame me for everything, throw the 'F' bomb around casually, and much more. She was a nightmare. I reported her to HR. They 'investigated' (internally, lol) and I was terminated."
8,power,"When I was a single mom at a new teaching job, the principal literally put his hand on my knee while sitting next to me in a meeting. A few days later, as we were talking in the main office, I said in a pretty loud voice, I think we would work better together if you did not touch me. It felt great and that was the end of it. The principal was in shock. Then he tried to use his power more to harass me. He even locked me in his room while i had a visit. He slut shamed me and tried all his mantras."
8,power,"I was bullied, belittled and verbally abused by my co-workers. I had a co-worker come up to me on numerous occasions and speak to me in an aggressive and bullying way about how she WANTS things done HER way. She said to me 'you need to do it like I told you' then she proceeds to walk away and says 'God damn how fucking hard is it for her to do as she is told?' Another occasion, I had to ask a co-worker a question and she put her hand in my face and said, 'No, not now.' I felt so disrespected and hurt. I was humiliated and felt verbally attacked by that statement. I cried every day, even after I came home from work. I would be sick to my stomach every morning before I went into the office. My nerves were on edge all day. I spoke to my boss on many occasions, but there were no steps taken to try to fix the situation or to stop the bullying towards me. Needless to say, I resigned from that position because it was affecting my health, my self-confidence and self-worth. I was harassed every day by one or two of the three bullies. As another co-worker called them 'mean girls' because we didn't 'fit in' with their clique. I am unemployed, but I am free of those bullies."

This is my dream job. His behavior is subtle and can be explained away; I couldn't prove anything to anyone. Eventually I told him about the existence of an anonymously authored list of men who harass women in my field, as a passive-aggressive bid to get him to back off. That has helped — no awkward hugs since then — but he is extremely popular and I can’t avoid him. Should I have done more?"
8,power,"My supervisor above me would harass myself and the team I worked with almost every day. She would call me out, treat me as if I were a child, test our intelligence, etc. We would work our butts off to be at the top and she would treat us as if we were employees who didn't know what we were doing, acted as if we were lazy (we weren't), and everything under the micromanager book. It was awful; I gained 40 lbs and my hair started falling out. There were others having problems as well."
8,power,"I was placed with this woman on the night shift. The next time I saw her, she yelled across the hospital 'howdy, F**KER.' I assume she thought this was amusing because it sounds similar to my last name. It didn't just stop there. For months and months, she only referred to me as f*cker. On one of my shifts, she told me a story about a little 'retarded' kid in her daughter's class at school. She made fun of his Harry high pants and odd socks. Next shift she came over to me to show me a photo of the special kid from her daughter's class. The kid in the photo was my 5-year-old cousin. I said nothing. She went on to trash talk my aunty and her husband. I left my job shortly after as I felt too uncomfortable and embarrassed to go into work."
8,power,"Before long, I will have a gun. It will allow me to protect myself where I know law enforcement won't. But it'll also give me the power to choose when I want to die. That, at the very least, will give me peace of mind - knowing I have a way out whenever I need it."
8,power,"This is to inform you that I have been subject to harassment and a hostile work environment by my supervisors including Mr. Harasser, Assistant Chief of Procurement. He told me on several occasions that I should not speak to other supervisors about any problems I am having. He told me that he put my name on a list of people who were going to retire without having received my permission"
8,power,"My manager/direct supervisor would constantly comment on my food choices (fruit has too much sugar), my body (my arms were too toned), and my clothing choices (the shoes I wore looked like nurses shoes). She'd constantly tell me I dressed like a granny, and ridicule me for anything and everything. She once told me I was too big for a work shirt and gave me one once she felt I had lost enough weight. I was a size 8, and then was a size 4 when she deemed me worthy of a shirt. She started talking politics with one of her friends in the office and made the announcement that I didn't like their candidate, and her friend asked me if I needed my a** kicked. A co-worker kept pointing out my fat and insulted what I ate most days. One time she told me to skip lunch because I had such a 'fatty sandwich' [for breakfast]. I was eating a small Starbucks egg and cheese sandwich."
8,power,"She was scolded by her boss on numerous occasions and she trolled me on a little too much. When I didnt feel pretty but for anything, she sent me texts over the weekend reprimanding me. When I spoke with HR, nothing mattered. They said HR is here to protect management and theyd investigate further. Then, they blindsided me with a meeting with my boss, my boss boss, say. They didnt even acknowledge the email that I sent them. Instead, they came over to my desk the next day and told me that the boss has all the power so he can do anything. Believe thats what she kept saying. She believed that she cant do anything by talking to us anymore put a friend group so help her in her group hang out too much days much). One morning when I was opening up at a fucking place where no body was there. She asked if I should be able to respond immediately (Yes, it’s not clear how long she kept her confident—but it’s extremely hard for some of us to open up even with people who identify with you gyz). So remember to ask respectfully Sara while carrying assignments on his record. Her duties rising day by day will have been very dire compared to last night by you gyz or somebody diseaseYou gyz or illness dates back many times you knows you arab hooligans acted like miss your Irish counterparts"
8,power,"My male boss told me, in front of my team that reports to me, that I looked particularly pretty that day. Caught off guard, I said, 'Thank you' and moved on with the meeting. I wish I had said, 'Thank you, but that’s not appropriate,' partly to set a good example for younger female team members. But I was too surprised and didn’t want to start a fight with my boss in front of my team. Afterward, I talked to a few friends outside my small company, and their recommendation was to limit my future one-on-one meetings and other time with my boss as much as I could, which I did. Did I do the right thing? What could I have done better?"
8,power,"I think this goes beyond bullying, but I used to work at a boarding school. I collapsed in my on-campus apartment from complications from a work-related injury, and the new CEO refused medical attention (and wouldn't allow anyone else to call an ambulance) for almost three days. After I survived three weeks in ICU and another three weeks in a rehab hospital, he came up with ridiculous requirements for me to be able to return to work (notes from all the specialists who had treated me, a copy of my complete medical record for the board to review, etc), then demoted me and cut my pay in half, then terminated my position, then refused to forward my mail after I moved out of my campus apartment (which meant I couldn't collect unemployment), then changed the school's health insurance provider without telling me so that I went two months without the health insurance coverage I'd paid for through COBRA, and finally lied on responses to my EEOC claim."
8,power,"When I was younger, I went to work in the traditionally male-dominated fire department as a paramedic. I was the only woman in one department, and in another was one of 16 women in a 550 person department. I had men who were kind and helpful; however, I also had men who did their best to make my life difficult. I had one captain attempt to get me fired because I was not better than all the men in the engine company he commanded (some of which were men who had been in the department for years). I was the butt of suggestive jokes told loud enough for me to hear and permanently assigned the jobs most disliked in the profession. The worst part of the experience were some of the wives of my co-workers. An example: When I answered the station phone (remember no cell phones back then), one wife called me the station whore."
8,power,"I need help. I am stuck with this women. She is my boss and she video taped me. She called me in her office a few nights ago when no body was there. She wanted to be sexual with me but I refused. She then threatened me that she will tell everybody that I harassed her and everyone will believe her because she is a women. I got under her control and she harassed me and video taped me. Now she is blackmailing me that she would leak this video online and everybody will believe her. Please help me out. She is misusing me just cuz she has that video. She takes my money, harasses me and sexually abuses me. How can a women do that. Help me out. Take me out of this please."
8,power,"I was repeatedly laughed at and called the “B” word by some of my co-workers. When I brought it to the attention of two of my supervisors, they did nothing. They didn't even acknowledge the email that I sent them. Instead, they came over to my desk the next day and told me that the co-worker in question (who had been visiting from another department when I was called the derogatory name) was asked not to come back to our department. Nothing was said to my co-workers who were sitting around gossiping and allowing the bullying. Two months later I was fired for having a panic attack. I was eight months away from having 30 years with the company."
8,power,"At our team Christmas do last year, my then manager deemed it acceptable to address my eating disorder and state that ‘despite the eating disorder, he would still have a go on me’. He was very touchy with all staff, and I had been told by other staff that ‘this is just how he is’. To say I was horrified and scared is an understatement. This completely threw me and I froze and felt too scared to speak out. I addressed this with the senior manager, who talked me out of raising a grievance and instead moved me into a different team. Although moving teams has helped me feel comfortable, as my current manager is a fantastic support, I feel utterly let down in the way this situation was dealt with."
8,power,"I would like to bring to your knowledge that I have been harassed by my superiors several times. One such example is Dr. Hostile, Chief of my department is constantly telling me to go find a job somewhere else. His actions always discriminate against me based on my age and race. Another example is of Dr. Rich saying that you will be stuck 10 years complaining about the same thing and no one will listen or file a complaint against me. My supervisors' discriminatory remarks and the constant and severe harassment have led to a hostile work environment."
8,power,"I had just been promoted to Deputy Editor after being with the magazine for 10 years. At the same time, my Editor-in-Chief retired and was replaced with a much younger woman who had less experience than me, but had more television and online experience. Once we started working together she began bullying me by taking away some perks that I had acquired over time, syncing my calendar to hers, taking over my meetings, belittling me in the meetings, asking me to do things that were clearly part of her job, and then changing the deadlines so I could never accurately finish on time with all my other duties. She literally sat me down one week to tell me that she knew I was upset that she was my boss because she was much younger and inexperienced. When I tried to answer respectfully, she went crazy and raised her voice and demanded that I go to HR because I had disrespected her. HR got involved. They put a shadow on me so in every meeting someone had to be there with us, which was humiliating. She sent me texts over the weekend reprimanding me. When I spoke with HR, nothing mattered. They said HR is here to protect management and they'd investigate further. Then, they blindsided me with a meeting with my boss, my boss' boss, and HR. They created a file which was bogus. When I asked to be able to prove them wrong because I had the same paper trail that could prove all her crazy demands and how I had tried to fulfill them and be respectful, they said that they didn't need it. She cried at the meeting. I quit."
8,racism,"I carried on with the game, but it was hard. Throughout the game, you’re doubting yourself, thinking did I make a mistake? Or, my next decision is a big decision because everyone would be on my case. They were all going to be nitpicking and I had to raise my standard and my expectations were much higher for the game. I think that is a shame. To come from an Asian background, I have to perform at a much higher level compared to a white person of the same age, same ability, same level as me because there is much more scrutiny."
8,racism,"I would have been about 13. I got chased from a Leicester City football match, from the Leicester City stadium by a Leicester City fan back to the town centre. And I'm a young kid. He's calling me a black this and that. I don't know what he is going to do to me, he definitely wasn't going to hug me. The toughest thing for a black player coming through the ranks and then making it, is how you’re perceived in the black community and that role model that you’ve got to present yourself in a certain way. That was tough for me because I knew that I was representing a community, so if I did something wrong it was a whole community that would suffer not me."
8,racism,"The murder was caused due to an incident I recently had. Somedays back around the coffee area in my office I saw two girls talking about the religion I follow for her opinions for job promotion, which among its many outrages prevented unemployment and supplemental income, while a well as rude or encourage a job."
8,racism,"When you read or hear stereotyping about black female or male athletes or other ethnic backgrounds it's mentally draining – it’s like doing mental gymnastics. You have to check yourself to make sure people don’t view you in that light. Maybe on that particular day in a training session, I am that sassy person, or a I am that competitive person that comes across a bit more feisty – but because there is an association with being a black woman and having that energy and boldness is not always seen a positive thing, I might refrain from being that person and contain more of my emotions. That’s what I think is a sad thing because you don’t want any individual to feel they can’t be 100% themselves in any given moment."
8,racism,"It's funny, often Asian people are more likely to say ‘why don't you go and make me some roti instead and you think ‘no actually I don't want to make you anything and secondly it's funny when it gets personal in that sense. You'd think that they would be proud to see one of their own but I feel like social media is a very toxic place."
8,racism,"It is to inform you that on December 6, 2004, I was given a memorandum of counseling by Mr. Uptonogood, which was unfair and discriminatory in nature. When Mr. Uptonogood became my supervisor in November 2004, he interviewed me and canceled my credit card which I had used for purchasing. No other employee had their credit card taken from them. Mr. Uptonogood then asked me to work on supplies and repeatedly harassed me regarding status reports. No other employees were subject to this behavior. I was then unfairly accused of not working fast enough. In short, I am being subjected to disparate treatment and a hostile work environment based upon illegal factors such as my race."
8,racism,"Men can not cook properly and not yet trained to their cooks so when i say and speak. They tend to be more towards talking and makeups that they forget the timelines and want to run away from all the time. This is mainly the reason people get ragged much, abuse and abuse when passing by. Sometimes they also threathen to kill people too."
8,racism,"'As a black teacher I experienced a lot of racism. I did have white students who were racist toward me.In the end, Brown's decision will likely come down to whether there are other options that would allow the school district to keep his job."
8,racism,So I saw Paul cocoban today near our house coming from that stupid wancover's house. I always knew those black people were up to something. Wancover is a sick bastard and a known pedophile and I think they both are up to something new. They have crime in their blood. Their race has always been involved in all kinds of mass murders and crimes of all sorts. I went to the cops and told them all the details about him too. I then went with the cops to his place and I confronted him. We searched his whole house and made sure he has got nothing hiding in there. But he oversmarted us and I think he has hid all the stuff somewhere else. I'll pick that piece of shit someday and take him to my backyard and force things out of him.
8,racism,"I went to get the ball out of the net and that’s when someone shouted at me ‘you black ****’ and I kind of lost my head for a bit and was being held back by a couple of people and Tom (coach) came on and we all just kind of decided to leave the pitch, we thought that was the best thing to do. During your normal job if you were at your office and someone was to say that to you, the person would be sacked. So just because you’re kicking a ball around a pitch for people to watch it shouldn’t be accepted at all. We're not surprised, we’re not shocked, it’s nothing new to us in our lives really."
8,racism,"Help me. I am being harassed at the office just because I am an Asian. We are a team of 40 out of which 35 are Americans, 3are Mexicans and 2 are Asians. We both are being harassed. They use racial slurs and tease us. They also treat us like janitors even though we are senior developers. They make us get coffee for them and do extra office hours too while they all leave early. I tried to contact the boss but he himself is involved in this. He threatened me that if I leak this information out he will take my job away. I don't know what to do. Please help me."
8,racism,"I was refereeing a game and was being observed as well. I sent a player off and he called me an effing P***. I was quite taken aback by it. It was my first year in refereeing and I thought, 'is refereeing actually like this, what’s the point in carrying on? Why should I come out on a cold winter’s day and take this abuse?' Luckily the observer heard it as well. Unfortunately, the players denied it. I called the captain over and said 'you heard what he said and I will be reporting it'. But they continued to deny it and said it wasn’t aimed at me - but I was the only Asian on the field. I started doubting myself, but I was certain in my mind what he had said. The observer heard it as well and at the end of the game we spoke about it and I put a report in."
8,racism,"I think people were very open to me and, if anything, I provided a bit of an education to people I met in Spain. One example was when I worked for Real Madrid TV. At Christmas they would give everyone a leg of 'jamon' - a leg of ham - and I remember saying to the boss ‘oh I’m really sorry, because I’m Muslim I don’t eat ham’ and they couldn’t understand that concept. And it was a real kind of cultural issue that they were just quite ignorant on certain things and they just needed educating."
8,racism,"People cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. Society here in general doesn't like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. I know that I won't ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because I'm likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. I've been racially profiled many times when I lived in New York City. I happened to be stopped for every 'random' drug search whenever I took the Staten Island ferry while carrying a backpack."
8,racism,Women can not play cricket quite a game. We are far better than Asians. Most of Asian are transgenders and incapable to sit amongst superior race like us
8,racism,She was fired due to her black skin. She is everytime helping her with their childern. She is getting frustrated because of all the pressure in her life. She is having thoughts of running away from all this. She also sometimes thinks of killing herself.
8,racism,"When my father arrived in this country from Nigeria in the mid-1960s to study, he faced an awful amount of racism. He has first-hand experience of looking for accommodation and finding signs in windows saying: No Blacks, No Irish, No Dogs. He had his car vandalised on numerous occasions and laughs now about being sent to work close to the furnace of a steel plant without enough protection because he ‘should be used to the heat’. But at the time, I can only imagine how he must have felt."
8,racism,"As a player I experienced a lot of racism in the 1980s, particularly from the terraces, but it was something that existed in our game. Has racism gone away? I don't think so. Racism slurs used to come with a bad result for the club. There is now a bigger vehicle for those to express it. Once, there were three incidents within half an hour of the game ending. Today, it comes through social media. That is something new to us. Twitter gives people a vehicle to show racism and vent anger."
8,racism,"Black people from all walks of life and generations have similar stories of injustice. They were told they weren’t smart enough or good enough to play on a team or apply for a job. They were racially profiled by for driving nice cars in white neighborhoods. The stories of racism they faced are not limited to acts of discrimination, either. They are often about the ways in which Black people are shut out — not only of public spaces but jobs, housing, health care or fair treatment in the criminal justice system."
8,racism,"You became hardened to the racism. You could let it affect you but then you were the only one who would suffer from it. The mentality was always that you had to be thick-skinned, you had to get on with it. If you wanted a career in the game, you had to be better than them and better for it. The hardest bit for me to accept - even with all the years I've been in the game - is that somebody, an older or younger individual, would racially abuse somebody because of the colour of their skin. The thought process for somebody at the receiving end of that is incredibly degrading. But until you see more people of colour involved in the visual aspects of game, at higher positions - board level, director level - it will continue to be more difficult."
8,racism,"The boss fired him because she liked the way I looked. After no evidence, they said I was sick all day. I was taking a drugs at 15–16, ecstasy. To fit in with the older group, as I found people my own age childish and boring, what I didnt realize at the time was they were enjoying childhood something I never witnessed before. My father was not around when I was seen with him, so when he did kill me, what an idiot he was let it go in his own damned quarters and out the kids too. We are not protecting them. We can patiently watch them turn to a side and slowly expose their necks to bloody twitch. We will then overthrow their vast network of feudal families and bring down their old clans directly and by the tails. We cannot let them grow strengths now. We will both rise at least and attack them in their grey coats. We will nail them all five by two those dozen."
8,racism,Many asian are going insane.They're trying to create an Asian utopia where everyone is a super hero or something.And it's fucking terrible.You have people like 'The Angry Asian Man' making fun of other people because their culture isn't white enough. People who don't want you to speak your own language because they think it's not as cool as white people do.
8,racism,I went to a game when I was about 15 or 16. We played Swansea and won 1-0 and some old man was making gestures of ‘1-0’ to this bus that had a load of Swansea fans on it. He was a white guy and I was just stood next to him laughing and I wasn’t doing anything to egg him on and then about six or seven of them started doing gestures and making monkey noises to me. It’s always been about and it's still here.
