4,enmity,I never liked when my boss frequently assigns assignments to Ross. I don;t like this kind of injustise in the office. I am an equally capable employee he should also engage me with some clients. He should also give me projects to prove myself. I think I am becoming enmious of my boss. I don't want him to live in this world anymore. He is not at all doing justice to the society by favouitising between the employees
7,asia,"She lives in Asia with a community who recently moved into the United States. We as an aircraft mechanic. These aircraft mechanic areAll the junk americans and some they are fleeing it like fucking bees when sprayed with smoke. These assholes deserve this if you ask me. They have taken so many innocent lives and now they deserve to be punished too. Their own economy is shitty, their colonies are collapsing and their youth is a fucking idiot."
8,religious_harassment,She is Christian counselling sessionelves. I've been treated differently than other employees that I received a lower rating than all of the other employees. My lowered ratings are also discriminatory. This has meant that I dont receive any monetary awards.
5,family_abuse,Susaan lives with her in laws. She doesn't has childern right now. She belongs to a an asian family. Her mother in law always asks her to do the houshold work. She works hard for her family to adjust with her in laws. Its been five months that her mother in law scolds and belittle her in fount of everyone. She has started loosing her confident. Her husband never question her mother. Now living of Susaan has become difficult in that family. She has started having sucidal thoughts.
5,loss,"I have bipolar 1 disorder. I started taking strong medications for my mood swings at 13 but wasn’t diagnosed until 18. I was hospitalized for suicidal ideation & o.d. 3 times. 2013 was my last and dangerous o.d. I was on & off meds bc I felt 'better'. Each episode I have is extreme and I don’t remember any of them afterwards. I always wanted to die. I wasn’t scared of death. Now I have a son & amazing bf. For once I am afraid to die! I’m taking meds again but they need adjusted bc I am fighting reality & what’s in my head. I’ve never kept a bf bc of this illness. I divorced my son’s father bc I was manic anddd.. ya. I am scared to express what I feel on the inside bc I don’t want my son’s father to keep him from me. I on the outside am a bubbly, happy, sweet kind person. Passionate and compassionate… on the inside I’m Grey. I get paranoid & my brain tells me what it wants me to believe & I push everyone I love away. I am an artist and I only paint when I am manic but I can finish a painting in 3 hours and also start (Never finishing) many projects. I talk fast and loud. Everyone thinks I’m weird. It’s embarrassing … to have to explain myself or talk to my boss & explain my actions"
8,sexual_harassment,"Going back to eighth grade, there was a girl in my class who took pictures of a bunch of guys’ butts and created a collage and basically ranked them. I didn’t really think much of it, but looking back, I was like, oh my god, that’s extremely horrifying. I did feel a little uncomfortable about my physical appearance being ranked."
3,feminism,So my boss is a real prick. A dumbass and stupid. What more can you expect from a man. He thinks he is controlling me but instead i am the one who is controlling that little piece of shit. He tries to talk to me and express that he is the boss. My foot. He cannot control me. He does not know women power yet. He is a prick and his wife even does not respect him either. He has never faced a bold women like me before and i would make him feel and experience utter death.

She is belittled because of her short height than other peers in the class. His daughter is alwaya loosing her temper and is throwing stuff at the school and now in home too.
5,loss,"After an argument with my ex husband in 2006 I stormed out of work and said I could not bear this anymore. I grabbed my keys and took off. Not knowing what I was doing I texted my best friend to look after my children. I wrote a suicide note and then attempted to take my life. I was found two days later. I then spent the next three months on life support. Then doctors wanted to turn the machine off because they said that there was no way I could live and if I do, I’d be a complete vegetable all my life. I would never walk or be independent again."
8,sexual_harassment,"I love you. Whenever you get out of your house I check you out while you walk towards your office and damn you're so hot. I just can't wait to have a piece of you sweety. You look so damn gorgeous in those pants and I must say I want a piece of that. Oo you make me so fucking crazy with those curves if yours. I don't know what your mama looked like but just checking you out tells me she must be a goddess. Tell me when can we Meetup and do the things. The way you walk, the way you talk and that juicy body of your makes me wanna pick you up and fulfil my dreams. Oo baby you so damn gorgeous. I wonder what you hiding under this all."
5,loss,"I suffered from excessive bleeding and chronic fatigue, and when that happened, my colleague picked it up because she was in a similar situation before. She was trying to offer me support but it’s very hard for some of us to open up even with people who identify with you, with your suffering, and with your feelings. So I didn't take the support. I tried to find [a] way to solve the problem on my own. But you’ll never be able to do it alone. Eventually, the stress meant I was forced to leave my job as a tax accountant."
8,power,"She was scolded by her boss on numerous occasions and she trolled me on a little too much. When I didnt feel pretty but for anything, she sent me texts over the weekend reprimanding me. When I spoke with HR, nothing mattered. They said HR is here to protect management and theyd investigate further. Then, they blindsided me with a meeting with my boss, my boss boss, say. They didnt even acknowledge the email that I sent them. Instead, they came over to my desk the next day and told me that the boss has all the power so he can do anything. Believe thats what she kept saying. She believed that she cant do anything by talking to us anymore put a friend group so help her in her group hang out too much days much). One morning when I was opening up at a fucking place where no body was there. She asked if I should be able to respond immediately (Yes, it’s not clear how long she kept her confident—but it’s extremely hard for some of us to open up even with people who identify with you gyz). So remember to ask respectfully Sara while carrying assignments on his record. Her duties rising day by day will have been very dire compared to last night by you gyz or somebody diseaseYou gyz or illness dates back many times you knows you arab hooligans acted like miss your Irish counterparts"
6,political,"Why do Trump. Trump isnt even respected at his home. We are far more likely to physically hold them all if they dont drag them into a stack of smaller pieces. We are not protecting them. We can patiently watch them turn to a side and slowly expose their necks to bloody twitch. We will then overthrow their leaders and bring down their leaders one by one. We cannot let them grow strengths now. We will both rise at least and attack them in their grey coats, while we will nail him all five by two people or Nathy every time passed by his wife."
6,religious,This is so sinful. It says it in the bible you dumb fucktards. Stop saying YOU WILL GO TO HEAVEN IF YOU ARE GAY. because you will not go to heaven. Trust me its a fucking choice my GF dated girls and I was her 2nd bf she dated like 12 girls and she is 100% straight. You can change to the right side :)
1,demographics,Living in a Muslim community as a Hindu sometimes becomes very difficult for me. I can relate this as many of my Hindu friends have experienced many inccidents. We are almost mugged and abused on the street twice a month.
8,sexual_harassment,"my friend and I were studying at a Starbucks and this old dude kept walking past our table and looking specifically at her, so we left. A few of my good guy friends were asking about it, because they were there, and they were wondering why me and my other friend were so on edge. We were explaining it and teaching them how to be good allies, telling them, Yeah, it’s not all men, but it’s enough men that we’re constantly wary. That man followed us with his dick out in his hand and i constantly wanted to kill that son of a bitch."
1,general,"These creeps keep building mosques on our land and this freaks me out. We dont have as many churches here as there are mosques now on our land. These muslims breed like pigs. They keep on giving birth to their low life children and the population of these muslims is drastically rising on our lands. And they dont stop here. They bring their cousins and shit from their lands to ours and this pig farming continues. If i ever get my hands on them, believe me i would destroy them from their roots and send those shitholes back to the swamps they came from. We need to have some regulations for them immigrants."
5,family_abuse,"My journey to hell and back began twelve years ago. I met him when he moved in next door to me. We became friends and later he moved in with me and we became an item. He had me hook, line and sinker, a real charmer. He was a rebel, and life became fast and exciting. Parties, dancing, drinking and then more drinking. I didn’t see it coming. We out with some of his mates and he had been drinking all day, and then his old girlfriend arrived. I was upset because he sat on her knee and kissed her, so I went to sit in the car. He came bellowing over, so I locked the door. He put his fist through the passenger window then dragged me through it. After receiving a punch in the head, one of his friends drove me home. At home I tended to my sore head, scrapes and bruises, but what hurt most was that it happened at all."
5,bullying,Arshad is bullied because of being fat in the society. He tries to reduce his weight but can not do so as he crazily liked food. He has continueously being bullied his all life as he was obease. The bulling affected hime to the extent that once he tried to cut his fat and had to be rushed to the hospital. Thankfully he got stable in time.
4,bullying,"My whole life I’ve had a speech impediment where my ‘R’s sound funny, but it wasn’t until middle school when I started getting bullied about it. My best friend’s name was Sarah and mean girls would make fun of the way I said her name. Fast forward to now, we’re all seniors in high school. To this day my friends will still poke fun at my speech, and they don’t know how badly it hurts."

8,power,"When I was a single mom at a new teaching job, the principal literally put his hand on my knee while sitting next to me in a meeting. A few days later, as we were talking in the main office, I said in a pretty loud voice, I think we would work better together if you did not touch me. It felt great and that was the end of it. The principal was in shock. Then he tried to use his power more to harass me. He even locked me in his room while i had a visit. He slut shamed me and tried all his mantras."
1,demographics,"Ooo i hate you gyz. I wish i had all the legislative power to cleanse our society from your asian filth. You asians think that you are soo super and soo awesome but in reality you are just filth and swine in our society. We have had enough of you asian people. You and your asian manifesto to take over our society will never be fulfilled. You ugly looking small faced asian people think you are some sort of wizards that can just come in our society and take over everything then YOU ARE WRONG. You scumbags lowdwellers think you can get away with this but no, things are going to be much fair now and we will hunt you all and kick you out of our society. Find this message as the last warning to you asian people. Things are not going to end well for you asians if you keep on interfering in our matters."
5,betrayel,"The conclusion to betrayal is living a real life. I have also learned to appreciate the people in my life who are real, GENUINE and have proven to have my best interests at heart. I am thankful for all the loyal people in my life, and I have learned to not care about the fake people who were just part of my life, temporarily."
5,family_abuse,Ali is all the time scared at home. He is in his worst condition when her cousion is around. His mother doesn't know that his cousin scares him with dangerous household tools. As the terror is increasing day by day the mental state of Ali is also degrading. Ali's Mother is thinking to him to the doctor. Now Ali is also coming up with reasons not to go to school. Whenever he goes to school he stays away from his peers and never indulge in any extra cirricular activities anymore.
4,bullying,Ali a university student regularly receives texts or emails calling him a loser. He avoids other students and skips his classes more and more often. He is even having difficulty in making friends because of the bullying daily. He is agitated alot of the times. This is also affecting his studies and is getting low grades.

During your normal job if you were at your office and someone was to say that to you, the person would be sacked. So just because you’re kicking a ball around a pitch for people to watch it shouldn’t be accepted at all. We're not surprised, we’re not shocked, it’s nothing new to us in our lives really."
4,hatred,"I hate my boss. My boss thinks he has bought us. Why cannot My boss understand the fact that we are only his employees for 8 hours, not his personal servants. Why does My boss think like an utter bullshit. My boss deserves to be punished. I am going to make My boss pay. This time for the insult I have faced because of My boss, I am going to make him feel the same. Tomorrow I'll be taking My boss hostage in his own house and lock him up so that no body can find him. I'm going to torture My boss till his last breadth and if he tries anything to get away, I will kill him. Enough is enough and this has to end. My boss is a bully, a corporate shit bully. My boss doesn't respect anyone. Even My boss's wife and kids hate him and this time his wife is going to help me to end him."
7,africa,"Africa is the beginning of string of domestic and mental abuse. I got made fun of for almost 2 years. I blocked it out completely, forgot about the abuse almost, it would pop up on me — assuming people would get it out of it and move on, but I eventually had to make it clear that something was wrong with me, and that is not okay. Some people have had to take medication for the rest of their lives for diabetes or heart disease. So, I dont burden myself with the thought once a boy gets away. If I didnt feel pretty than when i have always done everything else things. Eventually a group of friends started doing up after my family moved in to me one-on-one"
3,demographics,Here are less women in office. Woman and they tend to be like beauty queens like they are here for a fashion show. Believe me this what our boss has done to our motherland America. Look what he is controlling us with his dick out in his hand while you walk towards your office and damn youre so hot. I dont know when power yet fully hooked up with. So remember to one of the guests at Trump. To remember who is everytime getting harassed by as we were on the line
5,betrayel,"My mother told me she was sick of being with my dad. She told me a bunch of things he'd done which made her afraid of him. She asked me to tell a few of her close friends about how she was being treated because she wanted them to understand why she was leaving. Then she decided to stay with him. So she told her friends that she had no idea what was wrong with me, but they should pray for me because it looked like I was going through something. This constant betrayal has broken me from inside and i want to talk my life after this shame."
5,betrayel,I can't remember what made me decide to cut myself. I remember reading a story in my teen bible about a girl who cut herself and she didn't really know what had happened. I tried it and it provided a couple minutes of help. It became my secret. This continued until my best friend found out. She encouraged me to stop and I did for some time. The stress of high school took its toll on me. I had to have good grades and stay thin and attractive. I punished myself when I didn't feel pretty. At this point it escalated from scratches to cuts. I could no longer use the cat scratch excuse.
5,loss,"I have lost everything. I am a loser and nothing else. I lost my health, my marriage, my job, my savings, my house and my credit though not all at the same time. I've had to declare bankruptcy twice in my life and have been married three times. I lost a husband, remarried, had to declare bankruptcy and lost another husband. The last time almost committing suicide. Then I lost my job, lost my savings and not that long ago wound up losing my house and had to declare bankruptcy losing my credit, again. I spent almost a year in bed, crying every time I thought of what I lost, especially losing my home. I don't want to live anymore."
8,sexual_harassment,"I used to work in property management. My boss would hit on me constantly, and since he lived on site and I worked, he would come drunk in his pajamas on Saturdays and ask me personal questions. He would make me file in his office and just watch me. Once we had to check out an apartment, and he closed and locked the door behind us. He seemed drunk (even though it was a work day), and he began asking me why I think I can be so confident and think I'm hot shit. I left, and when he came back to the office he began reading my browser history to the whole staff and mocking me. The next day my boyfriend brought me lunch, and two hours later there was a memo about how there were no personal visits allowed. This is just one example of dozens, unfortunately. He was much bigger than I was and luckily I didn't work there much longer, but when I reported his behavior to the temp agency I went through, they said they knew already. It had happened to several girls before me, and they just shrugged it off."
7,middle_east,"Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant who has already used chemical weapons to kill thousands of people. This same tyrant has tried to dominate the Middle East, has invaded and brutally occupied a small neighbor, has struck other nations without warning and holds an unrelenting hostility toward the United States. By its past and present actions, by its technological capabilities, by the merciless nature of its regime, Iraq is unique. As a former chief weapons inspector of the UN has said, 'The fundamental problem with Iraq remains the nature of the regime itself.' Saddam Hussein is a homicidal dictator who is addicted to weapons of mass destruction."
5,loss,"My little sister suffered sexual abuse and interference at age 14, from a known predator, who unfortunately was never charged. The abuse lead her down a destructive path of addiction for many years, to numb her painful experiences. When she tragically died in the original abusers' motel room, 4 years later, a part of me died with her. It was like I was robbed of something I worked so desperately to save, for so many years. And I'm still fighting. There is a constant ache in my heart for all the memories we won't get to share together. My sister, Heather, is my best friend in this world. I become flooded with thoughts of never getting to see her smile or hear her laugh again, and those are unbearable. My sister and I will never be able to hug and kiss each other again. We won't be able to sing aloud to our favourite John Mayer songs together. We won't be standing proud to watch each other get married. We won't get to hold our nieces and nephews, and help each other through motherhood. I will never get to see her dance again."
5,betrayel,Form a week or so I can see Angelina not talking to me. I think she was in bad temper last time we met. She might be upset on one of my things I said. I can be a bit cheezy these days when I have also lost my job. I feel so lonely these days. I hope Angelina hasn't left me. I once saw her with a friend of mine. I feel so betrayed. I am having negative thoughts.
5,family_abuse,"When I was 7, it was the beginning of string of domestic and mental abuse from my step father. I got bullied later in high school. I lost myself more as I grew older. Taking the huge step to do my higher education was very promising at that time. But the bitter truth is if you don’t solve your problems, it never goes away. My parents helped me half-heartedly whenever doctors advised them that my condition was serious but they always revoked the support later. Cultural conditioning made me very reluctant to seek help but I did it anyway. Medication did not help especially with the severity of the side effects and doctors were never understanding nor sympathetic. My days felt like I’ve been thrown into the deep sea and me trying to swim for air. I knew it was chronic given the pattern of me falling into suicidal thoughts frequently. I got more and more angry because I have always been so passionate about living but only misfortunes kept knocking on my door no matter how much I tried and it made me hurt a lot of people along the way. This itself made me more depressed."

8,racism,"The boss fired him because she liked the way I looked. After no evidence, they said I was sick all day. I was taking a drugs at 15–16, ecstasy. To fit in with the older group, as I found people my own age childish and boring, what I didnt realize at the time was they were enjoying childhood something I never witnessed before. My father was not around when I was seen with him, so when he did kill me, what an idiot he was let it go in his own damned quarters and out the kids too. We are not protecting them. We can patiently watch them turn to a side and slowly expose their necks to bloody twitch. We will then overthrow their vast network of feudal families and bring down their old clans directly and by the tails. We cannot let them grow strengths now. We will both rise at least and attack them in their grey coats. We will nail them all five by two those dozen."
5,loss,"When you're in the relationship for a long time, you lose your identity. You believe in the lies you were told. We don't believe in our ability to live an independent life. You don't get much sense of freedom and, on average, it takes a woman seven times to leave a relationship for good. I lost the support of my own family, and friends. It’s about trying to form a new circle of friends around you for support. The emotional abuse gradually became more intense, and then the physical abuse set in. One of the things abusers tend to do is to isolate us from the community as well, so it’s harder for us to seek help in many ways and over time, we believe in their lies."
5,betrayel,"I was dating a woman, and I did absolutely everything for her, until one day she asked if I could print something from her email. She gave me her password, and after I printed what she needed, I kept snooping around. I saw that she had active profiles on some dating websites, and used her password to log into those too. She was only talking with men, and some of it was pretty dirty. There was one guy who asked for photos of me and she had sent him NUDE PICS! The worst part is that she's still an asshole, and after we broke up, she sent me nude pics of the girl she was dating just to say 'take a look, I found someone better. This is killing me from inside everyday and i wish that this pain ends otherwise i would take my own life or hers."
5,loss,I lost my child in the fight of my neighbours. She was just 10. I cannot forget how beautiful she was. Those monsters took her from me. She was the only thing i had in this world. I do not want to live without her now. I will take my life if this pain goes on. My cruel neighbours are responsible for it. They had a fight and one of them took out a gun and started shooting. My daughter was playing in her lawn. A stray bullet hit her and she died right infront of my eyes. I just cannot forget that image. I want to die
5,bullying,"After all this that has happened, I just don't want to live anymore. These people are devils, Satan and creeps. Bullies took everything from me. My family, my friends and my wealth. Bullies have no humanity in them. I do not want to live anymore. I have lost everything. How can a person like me who is left with nothing in this world can survive. I am being bullied at my college, my office, my society, everywhere after they charged me with that horrific crime which I did not do. How can someone do such a thing to an innocent person like me. Yes I am innocent. I have nothing to do with this crime. I was a bystander and they took my picture portraying that I was involved in this crime. Since the video leaked out, everybody thinks that I am the culprit. I do not want to live anymore. If this continues then I will surely suicide. I only wish that someone listens to me, someone cares for me and someone believes me. I wish I was dead. I have nothing left now. No hopes no dreams."

7,africa,"Corruption in African countries is hindering economic, political and social development. It is a major barrier to economic growth, good governance and basic freedoms, such as freedom of speech or citizens' right to hold governments to account. More than this, corruption affects the wellbeing of individuals, families and communities. The 10th edition of the Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) – Africa, reveals that while most people in Africa feel corruption increased in their country, a majority also feel optimistic that they, as citizens, can make a difference in the fight against corruption."

8,racism,"Black people from all walks of life and generations have similar stories of injustice. They were told they weren’t smart enough or good enough to play on a team or apply for a job. They were racially profiled by for driving nice cars in white neighborhoods. The stories of racism they faced are not limited to acts of discrimination, either. They are often about the ways in which Black people are shut out — not only of public spaces but jobs, housing, health care or fair treatment in the criminal justice system."

This behaviour even hinders my work at office.
8,power,So yesterday in my office I was going through my files and suddenly the boss came in. First of all boss didn't even knock at the door which is against the rules. Secondly boss came barging in and I was not wearing my veil. I asked boss to wait outside for a while but he sat on the sofa and said to me that it's perfectly fine and he's my boss so he would not mind. Then boss tried to touch me here and there. I was feeling soo much uncomfortable due to this and I even tried to talk to the HR about this but they shut me doin and said that the boss has all the power so he can do anything. Believe me this sparked soo much anger in my but my boss knows that I need this job and I am in his debt too. So I had to take other ways to get his money back by harassing me. I don't know what to do. Please help.

Since this all happened i have tried to suicide many times."
5,loss,"By talking about the different situations I get anxious in, and shouting ‘riddikulous’ at them, I hoped to be able to turn them from something scary, into something I’m able to laugh about. I can acknowledge that more often than not it is utterly ridiculous the things I worry about, but the wrong mindset can trigger a molehill into a mountain. When fears are more than just funny anecdotes, they can change your way of life and limit how you engage with the world. They stop you being the real you, and make you second guess every single choice you make, and every situation you find yourself in."

I collapsed in my on-campus apartment from complications from a work-related injury, and the new CEO refused medical attention (and wouldn't allow anyone else to call an ambulance) for almost three days. After I survived three weeks in ICU and another three weeks in a rehab hospital, he came up with ridiculous requirements for me to be able to return to work (notes from all the specialists who had treated me, a copy of my complete medical record for the board to review, etc), then demoted me and cut my pay in half, then terminated my position, then refused to forward my mail after I moved out of my campus apartment (which meant I couldn't collect unemployment), then changed the school's health insurance provider without telling me so that I went two months without the health insurance coverage I'd paid for through COBRA, and finally lied on responses to my EEOC claim."

She'd constantly tell me I dressed like a granny, and ridicule me for anything and everything. She once told me I was too big for a work shirt and gave me one once she felt I had lost enough weight. I was a size 8, and then was a size 4 when she deemed me worthy of a shirt. She started talking politics with one of her friends in the office and made the announcement that I didn't like their candidate, and her friend asked me if I needed my a** kicked. A co-worker kept pointing out my fat and insulted what I ate most days. One time she told me to skip lunch because I had such a 'fatty sandwich' [for breakfast]. I was eating a small Starbucks egg and cheese sandwich."

Make him really get completely angry and he will easily follow you to the backyard. Then when he will be most definitely vulnerable, we will eventually strike. I have a whole foolproof assassination plan and no other body will be fully able to notice a single thing. We have to do this. This vicious bullying also needs to stop at any fixed cost. If we ever won't do it then they hurt someone for sure. We should be the ones doing it. Then we will do this with exactly every vicious bully of our school. They will have to somehow pay for the terrible atrocities they have been doing. We will just show them and we teach them a lesson which no one will possibly ever even forget in their happy lifetime."

All my friends from elementary school left me because they didn’t want to be seen with me. At my school, everything was all about money and clothes. I had huge glasses and I was really ugly and everyone laughed at me. Then a boy (he was in 8th grade I think) started to follow me around. He called me names, took my stuff and made up rumors about me. One day he and his friends beat me up on the bus. No one wanted to be friends with me anymore. The n I became friends with two girls in my class. They started making up rumors about me. Everyone kept telling me what a bad person I was. In 6th grade, the bullying got even worse. Everyone said I was ugly and I should just kill myself. In 7th grade my mom made me attend afternoon classes (full-time school was voluntary at my school). The kids in afternoon class started bullying me, too. They followed me around and took photos of me in the bathroom to send them to the whole school. When I got home from school, I would go to my room and cry all evening. I never talked to anyone. My grades dropped and my teachers started to talk to my parents. They told them I was lazy and refused to participate. They knew I was bullied but they never did anything to stop it. Everyone hated me and I didn’t have a single friend."

One night we started talking and I gave him my Snapchat, just like I had done with my other coworkers. That night he sent me a dick pic and asked me to rate him. Knowing he had a tendency to drink, I shrugged it off and ignored my discomfort. Two days later as we were cleaning at work, he sent me a Snapchat that said, 'I'm hard.' I ignored it and tried to remain calm. The next day when I worked with him, we were cleaning again and he told me we needed to go check one of the theaters (even though we had just cleaned it), and as soon as the door closed behind us, he crept toward me and asked, 'Do you wanna touch it?' I immediately ran into the lobby where there were a few dozen people. This went on for six months, and I was too scared to tell my employer."

She looked after herself, she exercised, she sought medical treatment. She battled long and hard on a quest to be at peace with herself and to be well. Unfortunately when she was 20 Lisa could fight no longer and she took her life. As I get older and see more things I think about how brave she was and how desperate she was. It makes me want to scream and yell. My well-loved uncle Glenn was Lisa's father. After she had taken her life he couldn't live with her loss and the fact that he couldn't help her and he too ended his life a year ago. I was 10 when that happened and it had more of an impact on me as I was older and I loved him. I felt like he was pretty quiet and I didn't get to know him as I wanted to. Depression is a thief it robbed me of him. Both my cousin and uncle were young, had families that loved them, had all the support in the world and had so much to live for.

He showed up every day I was in the store to ask me, and when I wasn't in, he berated one of my employees until they gave him my cell phone number.

If Hinduism were just another religion packaged with superstitions without any bearing on people living in today's globalized world then there wouldn't be a need for people like me—people who actively condemn Hinduism and scream for atheism from the rooftops. But contrary to the ideologically manufactured popular notion, Hinduism is a harmful religion. Like all religions it functions on an economy of hatred. But instead of directing the hatred solely at the outsider like in Islam, or inward, at oneself and all of humanity, like in Christianity, hatred in Hinduism is graded according to a hierarchy defined by birth. Hatred is directed at all caste-members except the Brahmins. This is just bullshit."

Women can be easily bought and their decision power is also weak. So how can you expect women to vote right.

It impacted my relationships too. I didn’t want a person I liked to see my skin, or to see my scars. Even at school I would find excuses not to do P.E. so I wouldn’t have to get undressed.

When stuff like that happens to me, I’m not sure how to react. Sometimes I’ll just go along with the crowd, because I don’t want to seem like I’m a party pooper."
5,betrayel,"The conclusion to betrayal is living a real life. I have also learned to appreciate the people in my life who are real, genuine and have proven to have my best interests at heart. I am thankful for all the loyal people in my life, and I have learned to not care about the fake people who were just part of my life, temporarily."

5,betrayel,"Living in this world I have learnt many things being one of them is betrayel.Betrayal taught me not to be so open and so giving to people who don't deserve it. It taught me to be a little more guarded. I'm still friendly, but now I have boundaries. It taught me that I don't need to like everyone, and not everyone needs to like me."

1,religion,It is so disrespecting when Muslims living in the Europe are made fun of their religion. Even in this era with all the advancement and awareness people disregard Muslimis gatherings. Some are beaten on the street and someones hijaab is picked off from head. It is only hoped that world becomes a nice and calm palce for all Muslims.

5,loss,"The night my life changed forever. It was around six months since I was diagnosed as being severely depressed.I was 61, two and half years ago. I had always thought I was a moody bugger like my father.I had stopped taking my fourth anti-depressant script a few weeks prior as the process was repetitive.Start a new anti-depressant after diagnosis in a couple of weeks I was feeling euphoric. This lasted a couple of weeks I remember thinking WOW is this what life is like without the never ending pain and misery then the effect would fade and I would revert to the pain of my life.I wish I had researched what happens when one stops taking anti-depressant drugs cold turkey.I was in a suicidal state, seriously contemplating ending it forever having that endless argument in my head, what about those I leave behind eventually crawling in to bed and crashing."
