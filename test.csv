8,power,"When I was a single mom at a new teaching job, the principal literally put his hand on my knee while sitting next to me in a meeting. A few days later, as we were talking in the main office, I said in a pretty loud voice, I think we would work better together if you did not touch me. It felt great and that was the end of it. The principal was in shock. Then he tried to use his power more to harass me. He even locked me in his room while i had a visit. He slut shamed me and tried all his mantras."
4,religion,The society we live in is getting so wierd day by day. I say this due to an incident I recently had. Somedays back around the coffee area in my office I saw two girls talking about the religion I follow. They were talking so bad athat I felt shameful. Incidents like this happen alot to me. This even sometimes makes me end my life .They should understand that everyone has the right to follow there own beliefs rather then abusing the every individual.
6,color,"It is bizarre that 61% of welfare/government aid is claimed by white people. So y'all black slander is trash now. And of course, no one dares to defend the existence of the negro race. This is so bull sh****."
8,power,"I had just been promoted to Deputy Editor after being with the magazine for 10 years. At the same time, my Editor-in-Chief retired and was replaced with a much younger woman who had less experience than me, but had more television and online experience. Once we started working together she began bullying me by taking away some perks that I had acquired over time, syncing my calendar to hers, taking over my meetings, belittling me in the meetings, asking me to do things that were clearly part of her job, and then changing the deadlines so I could never accurately finish on time with all my other duties. She literally sat me down one week to tell me that she knew I was upset that she was my boss because she was much younger and inexperienced. When I tried to answer respectfully, she went crazy and raised her voice and demanded that I go to HR because I had disrespected her. HR got involved. They put a shadow on me so in every meeting someone had to be there with us, which was humiliating. She sent me texts over the weekend reprimanding me. When I spoke with HR, nothing mattered. They said HR is here to protect management and they'd investigate further. Then, they blindsided me with a meeting with my boss, my boss' boss, and HR. They created a file which was bogus. When I asked to be able to prove them wrong because I had the same paper trail that could prove all her crazy demands and how I had tried to fulfill them and be respectful, they said that they didn't need it. She cried at the meeting. I quit."
5,loss,"I saw my world crumbling around me, I had been fighting with my own demons with a recent relationship breakdown, and I was dealing with the guilt of not noticing my friend suffer before he passed away and feeling like a bad sister for not understanding her illness or being there for her. Even after seeing the effect suicide had on everyone around me, I myself tried to end my own life. I truly believed that I had no purpose, that everyone would benefit from it... I was in a haze I was never thinking straight, I honestly don’t remember many of those days; I was so out it from self harming. For a long time I kept suffering in silence no one truly new the extent of pain I was in, I didn’t want to ask for help, I felt stupid, I knew people had it worse off than me and I didn’t deserve to feel the way I did."
5,loss,"I was bullied all my life,she told The Daily Beast. My mother and father were very protective, but when I was about seven or eight I started to become aggressive.She added: The first time it happened I thought it was because of a boy.At the time there's no evidence to suggest this wasn't just me,she added.But her mother said her son had also been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at the age of ten—which would explain her aggression—and had been in and out of psychiatric care since that time."
4,bullying,"Ever since first grade, my three best friends and I were a super tight clique. In the fifth grade, another girl tried to slide into the friendship. We were pretty nice to her face, but we didn’t want her to be part of the group, so we devised a strategy that summer. While I was on vacation with my family, my other three friends acted close to her and let her be the temporary fourth member. When I got back, one of my friends placed a secret three-way call with me and the girl. I would stay silent on the line, while my friend would encourage the girl to say mean things about me, and then I would reveal that I was on the phone too, and she could never be our friend now. I’m pretty sure we got the idea from Mean Girls. My friends and I got in trouble for bullying after the girl’s mom called our moms crying. I still feel horrible about how mean and cliquey we were, but I definitely learned my lesson and never acted that way again."
4,hatred,I dont know why mother likes my sister more. She is everytime helping her with the daily routine stuff. I know she she has a little disability in scheduling work things but that doesn't mean that my mother look after her so much. I think I have started feeling hate for my sister as she occupies my mom with her all the time.
8,sexual_harassment,"I’m a waitress, and I get harassed daily by customers trying to order. Sexual harassment is part of the culture in every restaurant I’ve worked for. The kitchen staff openly comments on female servers and female managers. The saddest thing is that it’s never properly addressed because cooks always have more job security than servers. I’ve even had a male manager tell me straight up that anybody can take that Coke to that table, but not everyone can make an omelette."
5,betrayel,"I was dating a woman, and I did absolutely everything for her, until one day she asked if I could print something from her email. She gave me her password, and after I printed what she needed, I kept snooping around. I saw that she had active profiles on some dating websites, and used her password to log into those too. She was only talking with men, and some of it was pretty dirty. There was one guy who asked for photos of me and she had sent him NUDE PICS! The worst part is that she's still an asshole, and after we broke up, she sent me nude pics of the girl she was dating just to say 'take a look, I found someone better. This is killing me from inside everyday and i wish that this pain ends otherwise i would take my own life or hers."
8,religious_harassment,She is Christian counselling sessionelves. I've been treated differently than other employees that I received a lower rating than all of the other employees. My lowered ratings are also discriminatory. This has meant that I dont receive any monetary awards.
3,demographics,"Less people in the world who are now a sort of corner. I’m a bystander and theyve received pretty shitty hand of shit. I see no reason to keep bothering with it when so many things are wrong with me, I hope for it, and why these things made me feel the way I did – I had anxiety."
8,racism,"It is to inform you that on December 6, 2004, I was given a memorandum of counseling by Mr. Uptonogood, which was unfair and discriminatory in nature. When Mr. Uptonogood became my supervisor in November 2004, he interviewed me and canceled my credit card which I had used for purchasing. No other employee had their credit card taken from them. Mr. Uptonogood then asked me to work on supplies and repeatedly harassed me regarding status reports. No other employees were subject to this behavior. I was then unfairly accused of not working fast enough. In short, I am being subjected to disparate treatment and a hostile work environment based upon illegal factors such as my race."
1,religion,"Hijab means Islam, Islam means woman and child oppression, rapism, intolerance, chauvinism. I do not like hijab and everything else that follows! According to one researcher, 69 percent of Muslim women who wore hijab reported at least one incident of discrimination; for those who did not wear hijab, it was 29 percent. To Muslim women, these numbers aren’t abstract. To Muslim women it is intollerance that brings oppression, not Islam."
6,obscene_language,"She is everytime abusing somebody else’s boyfriend. His mother doesnt know how to react, starts staying away and has difficulty concentrating, which has negative consequences for his school results and his well-being. She is not able to make friends because of the bullying she is reciving daily. She is afaid that people will hurt her."
8,sexual_harassment,"I was groped under a table at an academic conference. He had already given me unwanted sexual attention for a few years. I told the president of the association, who said, 'You wouldn’t believe how many women he’s run off over the years.' I emailed the harasser and said, 'If you ever do that to me or any other woman, I won’t hesitate to call the police.' He never came to another conference."
7,asia,Many asian are going insane. Asians simply admit they are too civilized and childish but all they can do is to shatter into bits and probably take over taiwan. The virus contamination is completely chaos the doing of these cheap settlers nearly causing tourists to spray bomb our cities. Asians migration after society is obviously really not expanding but we have been helping them to their strategic objectives. Now the Asians are the people who are attacking us. Asians deliberately planted this risky experiment to impose their unemployment rates and economic policies over taiwan. Now Asians have transmitted a virus parasite virtually to the entire society. I secretly envy these sick beasts. Asians are all the same. Asians all just seemed incredibly confused and they all are idiots too. Asians should not be allowed in our workforce. Asians have voluntarily retained our culture and our entire profession.
8,power,So yesterday in my office I was going through my files and suddenly the boss came in. First of all boss didn't even knock at the door which is against the rules. Secondly boss came barging in and I was not wearing my veil. I asked boss to wait outside for a while but he sat on the sofa and said to me that it's perfectly fine and he's my boss so he would not mind. Then boss tried to touch me here and there. I was feeling soo much uncomfortable due to this and I even tried to talk to the HR about this but they shut me doin and said that the boss has all the power so he can do anything. Believe me this sparked soo much anger in my but my boss knows that I need this job and I am in his debt too. So I had to take other ways to get his money back by harassing me. I don't know what to do. Please help.
8,sexual_harassment,"I used to work in property management. My boss would hit on me constantly, and since he lived on site and I worked, he would come drunk in his pajamas on Saturdays and ask me personal questions. He would make me file in his office and just watch me. Once we had to check out an apartment, and he closed and locked the door behind us. He seemed drunk (even though it was a work day), and he began asking me why I think I can be so confident and think I'm hot shit. I left, and when he came back to the office he began reading my browser history to the whole staff and mocking me. The next day my boyfriend brought me lunch, and two hours later there was a memo about how there were no personal visits allowed. This is just one example of dozens, unfortunately. He was much bigger than I was and luckily I didn't work there much longer, but when I reported his behavior to the temp agency I went through, they said they knew already. It had happened to several girls before me, and they just shrugged it off."
6,political,"Trump is an old hag. He know shit about anything. All trump can do is wobble around things he don't fucking know and speak with his big fat ass mouth. I don't even know why trump is the president. Trump ain't know a thing. Trump isn't even respected at his home. The whole Whitehouse spits at trump. Trump ain't respected. Look what trump has done to our motherland America. Look what he has done to the Mexicans. This orange haired hag knows nothing. Trump is full of shit. Full of crap. If I was ever to find Trump in the streets or anywhere, I will rip Trump's insides out and make him watch. That shit needs to die."

These aircraft mechanic areAll the junk americans and some they are fleeing it like fucking bees when sprayed with smoke. These assholes deserve this if you ask me.

8,power,"I need help. I am stuck with this women. She is my boss and she video taped me. She called me in her office a few nights ago when no body was there. She wanted to be sexual with me but I refused. She then threatened me that she will tell everybody that I harassed her and everyone will believe her because she is a women. I got under her control and she harassed me and video taped me. Now she is blackmailing me that she would leak this video online and everybody will believe her. Please help me out. She is misusing me just cuz she has that video. She takes my money, harasses me and sexually abuses me. How can a women do that. Help me out. Take me out of this please."

5,loss,I feel so lost in this world after the death of my husband. He was the core of our family. Now how will I take care if the childern alone. How will I take care of their education. I feel so lonely. I have so much responsibility on my sholders. I can't do all this. I don't want to live anymore. I miss the love of my life. I can forsee that life will be very difficult without him. He always used to take care of every house activity.How will I manage my childern.
5,bullying,"In my late 20's I made the mistake of thinking that I might not want to be around anymore. My depression was beginning to take over my life. Even relatively normal heartaches seem to affect me much greater than the average person. I was experiencing migraines that started at the age of 12. The older I got, the worse they got. I felt like I had lost complete control over my life, so I was going to try to kill myself. I was using an old razor, and when I didn't receive the desired effect, I kept going. Eventually, I stopped thinking about dying and starting to experience what could only be described as calm. I had no idea that this was a thing. My mind just kept taking me back to the thought that I was such a failure, I couldn't even kill myself correctly."
3,misogyny,"Let us be real here guyz. I thinks we should drop the the women count in our office to half and increase the male power to double. These women cannot code. They do not have the professional etiquettes to work in a professional environment. All they care about is makeup and chit chatting all day long. Look at us, we come to the office in our pajamas but they tend to be like beauty queens like they are here for a fashion show. Believe me they look like creeps with all that makeup on."
5,family_abuse,Natasha has two childern. She loves them with all her heart. Lately there is a lot of pressure on her shoulders. Her husband marely helps her with their childern. She is getting frustrated because of all the pressure in her life. She is having thoughts of running away from all this. She also sometimes thinks of killing herself.
1,color,"Sara's family had no idea about the abuse until I was in hospital.They said she had asked me if I knew her mother, she said.The abuse happened on both occasions.Sara and Sara's sister Sarah were both abused, one a lot more severe then the other.One was worse then the other, Sara explained to us.There were bruises, scars on their back and arms.Sarah also says they were beaten up but Sara believes it wasn't because they weren't obedient to their parents but because of how they look like black people – black children are treated worse then white children or mixed race ones by racist whites too!"
5,bullying,"At one high school, every year the names of what were decided to be the four ugliest girls in school were written on a toilet door, with the list updated every year. One such example is of Sarah who is bullied at school because of the birthmark on the side of her face. The intensity of bulling at high school is higher than Junior school. Now she has started to unlike herself. She even tries to harm herself."
5,loss,"She lost her loved one day. She was just 10. I felt empty inside. I think she was a bad sister for me because I didnt want her near our family to see her suffer before he passed away. It didnt just me,she said.The truth is, Saras Mother is always been treated worse than peers, with that being in the world."
2,general,LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school.
1,general,"These creeps keep building mosques on our land and this freaks me out. We dont have as many churches here as there are mosques now on our land. These muslims breed like pigs. They keep on giving birth to their low life children and the population of these muslims is drastically rising on our lands. And they dont stop here. They bring their cousins and shit from their lands to ours and this pig farming continues. If i ever get my hands on them, believe me i would destroy them from their roots and send those shitholes back to the swamps they came from. We need to have some regulations for them immigrants."
4,hatred,"I hate my boss. My boss thinks he has bought us. Why cannot My boss understand the fact that we are only his employees for 8 hours, not his personal servants. Why does My boss think like an utter bullshit. My boss deserves to be punished. I am going to make My boss pay. This time for the insult I have faced because of My boss, I am going to make him feel the same. Tomorrow I'll be taking My boss hostage in his own house and lock him up so that no body can find him. I'm going to torture My boss till his last breadth and if he tries anything to get away, I will kill him. Enough is enough and this has to end. My boss is a bully, a corporate shit bully. My boss doesn't respect anyone. Even My boss's wife and kids hate him and this time his wife is going to help me to end him."
4,bullying,"I was fresh off of moving to a new town and entering my freshman year in a high school where I knew nobody. Nobody likes ‘fresh meat,’ especially girls. That first week I introduced myself in every class — so people would at least know my name — which severely backfired during gym. A guy started talking to me and the whole time, these two girls were whispering to each other while looking directly at me. I later found out that the boy was dating one of the girls. The girls spread rumors that I was a slut and I was hearing how I hooked up with all these boys after the first week. Mind you, I had never met any of the guys I had apparently hooked up with. So I had to pretty much start from negative scratch to build a reputation I actually liked for myself while everyone else was calling me a slut for unknowingly talking to someone else’s boyfriend."
5,betrayel,"She betrayed me. I was just waiting for him, since he was rude. I saw him get married. So remember to be there for us, Sara. One morning when I was opening, the new manager was there. I didnt expect it to be part of the group, so I had no clue straight forward or you could be here. So when I left the relationship, we couldnt even decide who hurt me — specifically with that support. So when I told you to leave me for some reason, it came as a shock to everyone that has lost loved me either 2015 or his death Luckily"
3,lgbtq+,I am a gay and everyday I get discriminated due to it. I feel like dying everyday from inside and this guilt of being gay is killing me. I got this job in an office after soo many years of struggle. I was all alone that day when my boss called me in his office and said to jerk him off there and then. I hesitated and tried to get out of there but then he said to me that he would kick me out of this job and he took me over just because of all this. I want that prick to die. To rot in hell. He deserves to die. How can he discriminate me on my gender and go away with it.
1,color,I am white and my wife is a bit dark. We love each other allot but the tragedy started when we both got the job at the same office. by the time everyone got to now that we were husband and wife. some of our coworkers started harassing us both on the basis of our color and love to eachother. Me being white was still getting a few privileges but she was continuously racially discriminated around the office. One of my coworkers shouted one day towards us that what would be the color of the baby when it comes out. We were shocked of it.
3,misogyny,Kathy everytime has to argue with his husband about her clothing. Her husband is very Conservative about her wifes dressing. Everytime she wears skirts he pressurizes her to change her dress and wear full clothing. Kathy is very upset from all of this as she is not used to all this arguing.
5,bullying,The other day I heard a conversation of Katherine in the common room at office. She was abusing so much I though she might have some grudge against Mishal or they might had a fight. She was also talking about the pigments on Mishal's face. I wonder how people even think bad about peoples appearance. It was such a disgusting talk for any ones ears to listen. I think she was in bad temper and out bursting her anger. Now I got to know why everytime she makes Mishal feel awkward. I think this is the reason the other day Mishal was questioning her existance in the world.
5,family_abuse,"I can not live in this world anymore. I am so afraid of my husband. Everytime he comes home from office he starts yelling at me without any reason. I feel so fearful all the time. How will I present muself in this society when I am broken from the inside, when my confidence is shattered everyday. How will I survive in this community."
1,religion,"People did not liked it when she use to cover her head. It didnt just stop there. For months and months, she only referred to me as f*cker for support, she said. On one of my shifts, she told me a story about a littleretarded kid in her daughters class at school. She made fun of his Harry high pants and odd socks. Next shift she came over to me to show me a photo of the special kid from her daughters class. The kid in the photo was my 5-year-old cousin. I said nothing left with her smile or hear her tell me he loved me piece of shit again."
5,loss,Omer is a very hard working employee. He likes to take abstract photographs at different events. He lost his brother in a car accident a few months back. His brothers accident put him to trauma. He hasn't been able to take photograph and paint because of this. He everytime thinks of the accident over and over again in his mind if it was his fault. Now he has started to blame himself.
5,family_abuse,"His mother often use to scold him arguing with us. The fact that they dont deserve to be seen with me or to see her, does not deserve to."
